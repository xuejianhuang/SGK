April 25, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H. Res. 90, Demanding that the Government of the PRC and the CCP immediately release Mark Swidan, an American citizen who was detained unjustly and is sentenced to be executed by the Chinese government after his driver and translator were found in possession of illegal drugs. However, Mark Swidan was not in the country during the alleged offense and no drugs were found on him or in his hotel room. To this day the Chinese government has still not provided any credible evidence to back up its criminal charges and is merely attempting to use this American citizen for leverage. This resolution calls on the Biden administration to prioritize efforts to secure Mr. Swidan’s release and condemns the Chinese government and Chinese Community Party for its poor treatment of Mr. Swidan. I continue to keep Mr. Swidan in my thoughts and prayers, and I hope his quick release can be secured. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 418-0.<br />

Res. 311, Encouraging the expansion and strengthening of the Abraham Accords to urge other nations to normalize relations with Israel and ensure that existing agreements reap tangible security and economic benefits for the citizens of those countries and all peoples in the region. This resolution recognizes Israel’s 75th anniversary and celebrates the historic progress made by the Abraham Accords in creating a lasting peace in the Middle East. Under the Trump administration, Israel and multiple Middle Eastern and North African states signed the Abraham Accords, which finally established diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. This agreement set up a strong foundation of regional dialogue and cooperation, making it the most significant development towards Middle East peace in over 25 years. As a member of the Abraham Accords Caucus in Congress I am honored to support this resolution and continue to support the longstanding friendship and alliance between the U.S. and Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 401-19.<br />

I voted “Yes” on H.R. 734, Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023. This bill would prohibit biological men from competing in women’s sports and depriving women of athletic opportunities guaranteed by Title IX. The facts are clear: biological men are different from biological women and have distinct advantages over women in many athletic events. Allowing biological men to compete against women strips women of scholarship opportunities and the Title IX protections that generations of women fought for. I was disappointed that my Democratic colleagues opposed this commonsense bill, which I was honored to have introduced on behalf of the sponsor, Representative Greg Steube. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 219-203.<br /><br /><strong>April 19, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.J. Res. 42, Disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022. This resolution would nullify DC’s new extreme law that undermines the safety of our police officers and their ability to do their jobs effectively. This law is an attempt by the DC Council to support the defund the police movement. This law will restrict police access to the tools they need to do their jobs and even threaten their privacy. In fact, this law was so extreme, that even DC Mayor Muriel Bowser refused to sign it into law. Since the bill was enacted, 1,190 police offers have left the DC police force and the city has experienced a sharp spike in crime. We should combat America's growing crime crisis and anti-police rhetoric by supporting our law enforcement officers, and this should start right here in our Nation’s capital. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 229-189.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1149, the Countering Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act, as amended. The bill requires the Secretary of State to report on the presence of untrusted telecommunications equipment or services in the United States and our embassies and recommend acts to protect the U.S. from them. As Chinese companies such as TikTok and Huawei continue to target Americans, we must do more to combat these unsafe technologies by securing our telecommunications network from foreign interference and espionage. This bill passed the House by a vote of 410-8.<br /><br /><strong>April 18, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on the veto message for H.J. Res. 27, a joint resolution of disapproval of the Biden Administration’s “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule. Last December, the Biden Administration released its new navigable waters definition, overturning the previous Trump Administration rule. This change radically expands the scope of this federal regulation and fails to provide a firm definition of covered waterways. The change will enable the Environmental Protection Agency to apply red tape to large swaths of private and agricultural land across the country. Also, because the definition is not well crafted, many landowners will need to ask the EPA for clarification before doing work on their land, a process that can often take years. This is completely impractical and totally unworkable, amounting to an extreme power grab by the federal government. The Clean Water Act was enacted to protect major bodies of water like the Great Lakes or the Oswego River, not the drainage ditch next to your driveway. However, after this commonsense bill to passed in both the House and Senate with bipartisan majorities, President Biden decided to use the second veto of his presidency to kill this bill and protect the priorities of extreme activists. In response, I supported this resolution to override this veto. This bill required a 2/3 majority to pass and failed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 217-202.<br /><br /><strong>April 17, 2023</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1151, the Upholding Sovereignty of Airspace Act, as amended. This bill rebukes the Chinese Communist Party for its recent violation of American sovereignty with its high-altitude surveillance balloons this February. The bill introduces export controls on aerospace equipment to China, imposes sanctions on individuals related to the CCP’s aerospace surveillance program, and requires the Secretary of State to formulate a diplomatic strategy to alert allies about the scope of the CCP’s surveillance program. The United States cannot and will not allow foreign adversaries to violate our sovereignty, and we must forcefully condemn such provocative actions while also taking actions to prevent them from ever reoccurring. </span></span><span><span>This bill passed the House by a vote of 405-6. </span></span><br /><br /><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on </span></span><span><span>H.Res</span></span><span><span>. 240, Condemning recent actions taken by the Russian military to down a United States Air Force drone. This resolution denounces the Russian military for targeting an American drone in international airspace on March 14 with two of its fighter jets, which dumped fuel on the drone and then hit it. Additionally, it condemns the Russian armed forces for attempting to recover the drone after it crashed in the Black Sea.</span></span><span><span> These actions were nothing more than an attack on the freedom of navigation in international airspace and waters.

I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. Over the past two years of the Biden Administration, Americans have been suffering with historically high energy, gas, and diesel prices. This makes it unaffordable for countless Americans to heat their homes, travel to work, or power their lives—this is a simply unacceptable product of the administration’s far-left anti-energy policies. In response, H.R. 1 will hold the Biden administration accountable by streamlining bureaucracy and cutting red tape to help make it cheaper and faster to build domestic energy and critical mineral projects. It will also require the Department of Interior to follow the law and immediately resume quarterly lease sales on federal lands. We cannot let the Biden administration’s failed policies make us more reliant on often adversarial foreign powers for energy and the critical minerals we need to build the batteries and semiconductors that run our modern lives. I was honored to cosponsor this important piece of legislation, which is further proof that the new Republican majority in the House is continuing to work on behalf of the American people. This bill passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 225-204.<br /><br /><strong>March 27, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1154, the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act of 2023. For years, the People’s Republic of China has forcibly harvested organs from prisoners of conscience and inmates, a blatant crime against humanity. As a response to these egregious acts, this bill will authorize the Secretary of State to deny passports and visas to anyone involved in illegal organ trafficking. It will also mandate an annual report on forced harvesting in foreign countries and encourage the administration to apply necessary sanctions. As a nation we must stand for the sanctity of life and support persecuted groups. This bill passed the House by a vote of 413-2.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1107, the PRC Is Not a Developing Country Act. Even though the People’s Republic of China is now the second largest global economy and has rapidly increased its GDP per capita, it still benefits from many international program meant to benefit the poorest of nations. In response, this bill requires the Department of State to influence international organizations to reclassify China as a high income, upper middle income, or developed country instead of as a developing country. It will also make it the policy of the United States to dissuade those organizations from granting China any preferential treatment as a developing country. We can no longer let China profit by manipulating the game and taking advantage of programs meant to help truly poor nations. This bill passed the House by a vote of 415-0.<br /><br /><strong>March 24, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act. The pandemic was eye-opening for millions of parents across the country who saw their children being taught inappropriate content. Then when these parents decided to speak out on and engage with their children’s education, they were maligned and labeled domestic terrorists by the Biden administration. That is why I am an original cosponsor of this critical bill, which will guarantee parents the right to know what their children are being taught and what is occurring in our nation’s schools. My amendment was also included in this bill, which will require schools to inform parents if college-credit courses are terminated, including Advanced Placement and dual-enrollment classes. These programs provide students a cost-effective way to reduce the overall price of college. I am a strong supporter of every parent’s right to be involved in their child’s education and this legislation will further this important goal. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 213-208.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on H. Con. Res. 25, Authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center for a ceremony as part of the commemoration of the days of remembrance of victims of the Holocaust. This bill would allow for a Days of Remembrance Ceremony to be held in the Capitol Visitor Center on April 20, 2023. As anti-Semitism continues to rise throughout our country, Holocaust knowledge is at an all-time low. A recent survey showed that only 53% of American adults know that approximately six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust and 60% did not know how Hitler rose to power. These numbers are startling and we must do more to increase Holocaust education and awareness, especially as survivors continue to diminish in number. We must never allow a horror like the Holocaust to happen again. We must never forget. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 405-0.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span></span><strong>March 23, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 406, Providing Appropriate Recognition and Treatment Needed to Enhance Relations with ASEAN Act. ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, is an Indo-Pacific strategic partnership between 10 countries including nations such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. This bill would allow ASEAN diplomatic privileges in the U.S., similar to the rights given to the European Union. This would increase the partnership and relationship between the U.S. and ASEAN, which is critical given China’s rising power and influence in the region. I am honored to be a cosponsor of this bill and support its passage through the House of Representatives. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 388-33.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on the Veto message for H.J. Res. 30, Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to "Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights". After Congress passed a nullification resolution on a bipartisan basis, President Biden vetoed this resolution so private sector employee benefit plans and pensions can prioritize climate change and other far-left priorities over increasing the returns for beneficiaries. Further, as numerous single and multi-employer pensions continue to struggle with solvency issues, President Biden is allowing plan managers to de-prioritize returns to further their leftist political priorities, increasing the risk of future insolvency. Our seniors and those nearing retirement deserve fiduciaries that act in their best financial interests and who are not preoccupied with furthering their personal political beliefs. This rule violates this critical principle. I was honored to vote for this resolution the first time and I was honored to support this veto override to roll back President Biden’s shameful veto. This veto override failed to pass the House of Representatives by a vote of 219-200.<br /><br /><strong>March 22, 2023</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1159, To amend the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 to require periodic reviews and updated reports relating to the Department of State’s Taiwan Guidelines. This bill increases the Department of State’s reporting requirements to include a biannual update on U.S.-Taiwanese relations and any efforts to deepen and expand our relationship. As China continues to saber rattle and threaten Taiwan, the U.S. must continue to develop our partnership and strategic alliance.

This legislation requires the Director of National Intelligence to declassify documents relating to the origins of COVID-19 and the work of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Since the beginning of the pandemic, many individuals have speculated that COVID-19 originated in this Chinese laboratory; however, radical left-wing activists and the Biden administration have worked tirelessly to censor these theories, falsely labeling them “misinformation” and even “racist”. Recently, the Biden administration’s own Department of Energy concluded that the virus likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. While the Biden administration continues to avoid being honest with the American people about the origins of COVID, House Republicans are fighting to show the American people the facts. This bill will provide needed transparency and allow every American to see and examine the evidence for themselves.

This bill would <span>expand the Hatch Act to prohibit federal executive branch employees from using their official authority, whether on duty or off duty, to promote the censorship of lawful free speech on any computer service, such as social media. Since taking office, the Biden administration has attacked American</span>s’ <span>First Amendment rights under the fake label of “combatting misinformation.” The Biden administration has coordinated with social media companies, including Twitter, to censor and de</span>-<span>platform individuals </span>who<span> promote</span>d<span> narratives that the Biden administration disagree</span>d<span> with or </span>simply did not<span>like. Many of these falsely-labeled examples of “mis-information” have since been proven accurate, including the fact that COVID-19 likely came from the Wuhan Laboratory of Virology, which even the Department of Energy has admitted. This anti-American censorship should not be allowed to be carried about by individuals being paid to uphold and defend the Constitution. Importantly, this bill still allows the government to combat illegal speech, including obscene materials, classified national security information, or to combat criminal activity such as human or drug trafficking. This important bill will help ensure the federal government always upholds every American’s right to free speech, regardless of their viewpoint.

Additionally, this report would require an assessment of the vulnerabilities of these systems and any appropriate security measures and best practices that should be taken. While it is widely accepted that 5G is a much more secure technology, less is known about the vulnerabilities of our older heritage mobile networks.

I am strongly against endless wars and continue to press the executive branch to provide Congress with a long-term strategy for its operations in the region with clear benchmarks for success or failure. However, prohibiting the United States from maintaining this small deterrent force without a sufficient replacement or long-term plan in place will only serve to create a vacuum that could be exploited by our terrorist adversaries to threaten the United States and our allies.

This resolution would nullify DC’s recently passed Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022 allowing non-citizens, including illegal immigrants and foreign nationals, to vote in local elections. The DC law would even pave the way for foreign nationals and ambassadors to vote in DC elections, giving agents of the Communist Chinese and Russian governments a say in the governance of our national capital. This law is so extreme that even DC Mayor Muriel Bowser refused to provide her signature to the bill. It is a desperate move by the far-left DC Council, which is so desperate to distract from its mismanagement of our nation’s capital that they are willing to undermine the rights of American citizenship. Voting is one of the most fundamental rights that we enjoy as American citizens, and this right should be exclusively reserved for American citizens. As co-chair of the Election Integrity Caucus, I am working tirelessly to protect the sanctity of our ballot box and the rights of citizenship. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 260-162.<br />

I voted “Yes” on H.J. Res. 26, Disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022. This resolution would nullify DC’s new Revised Criminal Code Act, which reduces the penalties for many different crimes through lowering statutory maximums, eliminating almost all mandatory minimums, and by banning life imprisonment. This law reduces penalties for violent crimes, burglaries, and carjacking by as much as 80 percent and will only make the crime in DC worse and more dangerous. It also creates a new right for rapists to be released early from prison, undermining the safety of victims of sexual violence. This legislation was so radical that DC Mayor Muriel Bowser vetoed this bill, and it was only enacted after the DC Council voted to override her veto. It is also opposed by the DC Chief of Police Robert Contee and DC police officers across the board. The fatal shooting of DC Metro employee Robert Cunningham, who just a week ago heroically died tackling a shooter to the ground only blocks from the United States Capitol, reinforces how calamitous the far-left soft on crime policies can be. I will always fight against radical far-left activists in New York and across our nation as they continue to support the “Defund the Police” movement and soft-on-crime policies that are dangerous for the American people. It is vital to support our law enforcement and support putting dangerous criminals behind bars.  This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 250-173.<br />

Our nation watched in horror as the Biden administration allowed a Chinese spy balloon to fly over our country, including above sensitive military installations. The Biden administration must take a stronger stance against the CCP and this clear violation of our sovereignty and national airspace must never be repeated. This resolution makes it the official U.S. policy to promptly act to prevent any future foreign aerial surveillance devices, and calls on the Biden administration to provide more information about this spy balloon. The resolution also condemns the CCP for their aggressive and unprecedented actions.

I vote” Yes” on H.R. 185, which terminates the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rule that requires international air travelers to show proof of COVID-19 vaccinate before entering the United States. For years our country has been forced to deal with onerous COVID-19 mandates. Even as almost every country around the world has lifted their COVID-19 vaccination requirement for travelers, our leaders have decided to keep this unscientific restriction in place. Multiple studies have confirmed that COVID-19 vaccination status has negligible to nonexistent impact on an individual’s capacity to get sick with or spread the virus. It is time we finally eliminate this executive overreach and acknowledge this virus is now manageable and endemic. This legislation is just a starting point, and I will continue fighting to finally end the COVID-19 vaccination requirement at land ports of entry and ferry crossings on the Canadian border. We need our supply chains and tourism industry to finally return to normal. This bill passed the House by a vote of 227-201.<br /><br /><strong>February 6, 2023</strong><br />

Over the past few years, we have seen a troubling increase in the number of ransomware and cyber-attacks on our energy infrastructure, including the crippling 2021 attack on the Colonial pipeline. In response, this bill will provide financial assistance to graduate students who are studying the convergence of cybersecurity and energy infrastructure. Additionally, this bill would provide students and postdoctoral researchers with training and research opportunities at utilities and the Department of Energy’s National laboratories. It is critical for us to address the vulnerabilities in our energy sector and this legislation is a productive step forward in investing in the next-generation of energy security professionals.

I voted “Yes” on H. Res. 76, Removing a certain Member from a certain standing committee of the House. Since being elected to Congress in 2018, Representative Ilhan Omar (MN) has used her position as a member of Congress to peddle dangerous anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, including the despicable notion that members of Congress only support Israel for money. She has also minimized the horror of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and compared the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban. I was disappointed that not a single Democrat voted for this resolution despite Representative Omar’s complete lack of genuine remorse for her prior statements. The rhetoric espoused by Representative Omar calls into question her ability to be trusted to effectively address issues vital to America’s national security as a member of the important House Foreign Affairs Committee.  As a previous member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I understand the important role this committee plays in advancing America’s national security priorities. Someone who compares the U.S. to Hamas and espouses openly anti-Semitic rhetoric should not serve on this committee, which represents our nation and the people’s House on the world state.

However, the history is clear: time and again socialist dictators such as Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, and Kim Jong Un end up killing tens of millions of their own people – through starvation and mass murder. Socialism is a failed ideology that is antithetical to our American values of individual liberty and freedom. I was honored to be an original cosponsor of the resolution, and I was disappointed to see 86 of my colleagues vote against this simple resolution denouncing the horrors that socialism has brought to this world.  This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 328-86, with 14 members voting present.</span><span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong> <br />

I  voted “Yes” on H.R. 139, the SHOW UP Act. Since the onset of the pandemic, many federal agencies have been operating in a state of maximum telework, even though many of the documents these employees need for their jobs are not digitized and only on paper. This has resulted in countless Americans unable to rectify issues with the Social Security Administration, IRS, and many other federal agencies. That is simply unacceptable; Americans must know that their government works for them. This bill will require federal agencies to reinstate their telework policies from before the pandemic. The agencies will then only expand telework after they submit a plan to Congress and certify with the Office of Management and Budget that their telework policy will have a positive effect on performance. Unfortunately, many Democrats refused to support this commonsense legislation and instead support our current bureaucratic dysfunction. This bill passed the House by a vote of 221-206.<br /><strong> </strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.J.Res. 7, to revoke the COVID-19 national emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020. Throughout his presidency, President Biden has stated multiple times that the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Yet he continues to keep the COVID-19 national emergency in effect, most recently renewing it in February 18, 2022, well after the release of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Providing the federal government what amounts to almost permanent emergency powers leads to overreach. This resolution will finally end this national emergency. The American people are getting back to normal, it is time that there government does as well. That is why I am honored to be a cosponsor of this legislation. This bill passed the House by a vote of 229-197.<br /><br /><strong>January 31, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 497, the Freedom for Health Care Workers Act. Throughout the pandemic our healthcare workers put their lives on the line to help their fellow man. However, after this selfless work, the Biden Administration enacted an overreaching rule mandating healthcare workers be vaccinated against COVID-19, even though the vaccine has proven not to slow the spread of the virus and many of these same healthcare workers already had natural immunity through previous exposure to the virus. This mandate led to the mass firing of health workers, which has created staffing shortages in medical facilities, raising costs and undermining access to quality care, especially for those in rural communities. This legislation will finally undo this destructive mandate, allowing these health professionals to return to work. No American should lose access to employment or educational opportunities because of a personal health decision. This bill passed the House by a vote of 227-203.<br /><strong> </strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 382, the Pandemic is Over Act. Almost three years ago, Secretary Alex Azar enacted a public health emergency in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, despite President Biden repeatedly saying the pandemic is over, this emergency has been renewed repeatedly. This has allowed the administration to bypass certain grant requirements and regulations as imposed or determined by Congress. This bill will finally repeal this public health emergency and return our nation back to normal. It is time for Congress to finally end what has now become a clear presidential power grab. The temporary public health emergency was never intended to be a perpetual state of emergency. This bill passed the House by a vote of 220-210.</p><p><strong>January 27, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 500, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act of 2023. Currently, about 1 in 5 senior investors have been victimized by financial exploitation. The results are usually devastating for these Americans, who are often on fixed incomes and unable to recover from these terrible financial losses. In response, this legislation will give our financial industry more tools to fight against this type of fraud and deception. It will allow investment companies, such as mutual funds, to better protect seniors and adults with mental and physical disabilities by delaying the redemption period of any redeemable security if they believe it was requested through financial exploitation. The bill will also require the Securities and Exchange Commission to report to Congress on recommendations for legislative and regulatory changes on how to combat financial exploitation. It is important we protect these investors and ensure their hard-earned money is protected. This bill passed the House by a vote of 419-0.<br /><br /><strong>January 26, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 21, the Strategic Production Response Act. Our Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a federally-owned oil stockpile intended to protect our country’s energy supply in the face of a worldwide energy supply disruption. However, over the past two years, the Biden Administration has misused this public asset to hide its attack on domestic energy production and for personal political benefit. This bill will prevent this from ever happening again, requiring the president to open up additional federal land for oil and gas leases when selling oil from the SPR in a non-emergency situation. The solution to lowering energy prices is increasing reliable energy production, not playing gimmicks with the market. All Americans should have access to reliable and affordable energy to fuel their cars and homes. This bill passed the House by a vote of 221-205.<br /><br /><strong>January 25, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 346, the NOTAM Improvement Act of 2023. The safety of our country’s airspace is an issue of national importance. An especially vital component of maintaining safety is the NOTAM system, which alerts pilots to potential hazards along the flight route or at a location that could affect  the safety of the flight. The legislation will establish an FAA taskforce to draft recommendations to improve the NOTAM system and ensure its stability, resilience, and cybersecurity. This bill passed the House by a vote of 424-4.<br /><strong> </strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 400, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2023. This bill would increase access to capital and private equity for small businesses through the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program by increasing the amount of capital and surplus a financial institution or federal savings association can invest in an SBIC from 5% to 15%. It also would require approval from a federal regulator for financial institutions and federal savings associations seeking to invest more than 5%. This bill passed the House by a vote of 411-13.<br /><strong> </strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.Con.Res. 7, Commending the bravery, courage, and resolve of the women and men of Iran demonstrating in more than 133 cities and risking their safety to speak out against the Iranian regime's human rights abuses. On September 16, 2022, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini was detained by the morality police for violating the country’s strict dress codes. She later died in custody. Her death sparked mass protests across the country, leading in turn to a heavy-handed regime response. Hundreds of protestors have been killed by regime security forces. Thousands more have been detained on trumped up charges, and many of those in custody, especially women, have been subjected to cruel and inhumane torture. This resolution, which I introduced alongside Congressman Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (TX-10), was cosponsored by more than 60 members of Congress. In addition to expressing support for the courageous Iranian protestors demonstrating for their freedoms, the resolution also condemns the brutal beating and death of Mahsa Amini as well as the violent suppression by the Iranian regime of women and men participating in the current demonstrations. The murderous regime in Iran continues its violent crackdown on its citizens’ rights and civil liberties. Today, the House reaffirmed with one voice our commitment to support these brave protestors, who are more resolved than ever to fight this regime. These courageous Iranians are demanding a government that respects their rights at home, stops funding terrorism abroad, and makes peace with its neighbors. They are demanding a future built on freedom, justice, the rule of law, and prosperity. This resolution makes clear that the U.S. House of Representatives stands with them and that the United States will continue to do all it can to hold the regime, which is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, accountable. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 420-1.</p><p><strong>January 24, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 159, To implement merit-based reforms to the civil service hiring system that replace degree-based hiring with skills- and competency-based hiring, and for other purposes, as amended. When hiring civil servants, the federal government’s top priority should be proven competency rather than sometimes ineffectual educational requirements. While a traditional four-year degree may be the right path for many individuals, alternative skills and training options such as apprenticeships and career technical education is an equally valid option. This bill requires federal agencies to hire primarily based on the applicant’s competency, and less based on the candidate’s self-assessment or educational attainments. The legislation also directs subject matter experts to create and run competitive examinations to judge competencies; these results will then be shared with other agencies to ensure the federal civil service is able to hire the best candidates possible. Through thoughtfully expanding the potential pool of civil servants, we can ensure that the most qualified candidates are hired to serve the American people. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 422-2.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 300, the Settlement Agreement Information Database (SAID) Act. One of my top priorities as a member of Congress is ensuring that taxpayer funds are spent effectively and transparently. Currently, federal agencies have no uniform recordkeeping standard for their settlement agreement information and primarily publicize this information only by press release. These agreements are often negotiated by government attorneys behind closed doors, yet frequently have long lasting policy and fiscal ramifications. This bill would require federal agencies to publicly disclose any settlement agreements they enter into as part of a lawsuit so taxpayers and elected officials can know how their hard-earn tax dollars are being spent. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 425-0.<br /><br /><strong>January 12, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 22, the Protecting America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve from China Act. In April 2022, the Biden Administration sold nearly one million barrels of oil worth $98 million from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to Unipec America, a subsidiary of Sinopec, a company owned by the Chinese Communist Party. While the SPR was created to assure U.S. national and economic security, the Biden Administration has been using it to alter the price of oil for political purposes. The Biden administration has also refused to take the needed actions to boost domestic production of oil and natural gas, the only way for our nation to stabilize energy prices in the long run. This legislation will finally fix one of these blunders, preventing the Department of Energy from selling oil from the SPR to any entity under the ownership, control, or influence of the CCP. We should never use public resources to benefit our foreign adversaries at taxpayer expense. That is why I was happy to be a cosponsor of this important legislation and vote for its passage. This bill passed the House by a vote of 331-97.<br /><br /><strong>January 11, 2023</strong><br />
 I voted “Yes” on H. Con. Res. 3, Expressing the sense of Congress condemning the recent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups, and churches. The right to protest is fundamental to our self-governing Constitutional Republic and a right that I will always fight to uphold. However, after the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, radical pro-abortion extremists chose to react with violence and began attacking pro-life pregnancy centers, facilities, groups, and churches, including the CompassCare location in Amherst, New York. These pregnancy centers are vital to pregnant women nationwide, providing $270 million annually in services and support to expecting mothers. Any attack on these facilities hurts women and babies and undermines our constitutional right to peacefully assemble. That is why immediately after the attack on CompassCare, I led a letter to the Department of Justice demanding those responsible be brought to justice. This resolution builds on that work and calls upon the Biden administration to take greater action to ensure the safety and security of pro-life facilities, groups, and churches from violence by radical extremists. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 222-209.<br /><strong> </strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 26, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This commonsense bill will codify legal protections for babies born after a failed attempted abortion and guarantee these children the same care as any other newborn. While this bill should have passed with a strong bipartisan majority, Democrats have instead continued to stand by their radical abortion on-demand agenda, which includes refusing to guarantee all children the right to life. Democrats are no longer the party of “safe, legal, and rare” abortions and are now the party that actively celebrates this tragic practice . I will continue to support compassionate pro-life policies that ensure women and families, especially those facing unexpected pregnancies, have the tools, resources, and support they need to embrace a culture of  life. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 220-210.<br /><br /><strong>January 10, 2023</strong><br />
I<strong> </strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>voted “Yes” on H. Res. 11, Establishing the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. From China’s theft of American intellectual property, to unfair trade practices and hiding the true origins of the pandemic, the United States must do more to combat the rise of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Throughout my time in Congress, I have introduced and cosponsored numerous bills including the Stop CCP Infrastructure Act, the China Watchers Act, the No Chinese Communist SURPRISE Parties Act and the Turn OFF THE TAP Act to combat the CCP’s malign influence. This new Select Committee will lead the charge to restore our supply chains, end our economic dependence on China, and work to promote democracy and counter China’s dictatorial repression. It will also build on the House Republican’s China Task Force, which conducted great work last Congress. I am optimistic that this long overdue committee will bring all Americans together to finally take the China threat seriously and combat the rise of China and its techno-authoritarian model. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 365-65.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H. Res. 12, Establishing a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government as a select investigative subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary. For years, members of the federal bureaucracy have weaponized the federal government’s powers against private citizens in an unprecedented manner. From the FBI investigating parents raising concerns about their children’s education, to the Department of Homeland Security encouraging Twitter to suppress conservatives, it is clear that the federal government has been prejudicially targeting Americans with different ideological viewpoints. Even in light of this mounting evidence, last congress Democrats systematically refused to hold the Biden administration accountable for these clear attacks on the rights of private citizens. This select subcommittee is not only important, it is vitally necessary to preserve the freedoms we hold dear in our self-governing Constitutional Republic. I look forward to monitoring this subcommittee’s work closely and working with its members to ensure accountability is restored to Washington. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 221-211.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>January 9, 2023</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H. Res. 5 to adopt the Rules of the 118th Congress. For the past four years Speaker Pelosi and Congressional Democrats have undone long held House of Representatives precedent to centralize power with Congressional leadership and the majority, at the expense of rank-in-file representatives and the minority party. These new House rules undoes this damage, returning power to the people’s representatives. First, it will require legislation to be released at least 72 hours before a vote, so the language can be fully read and adequately considered. It also finally ends proxy voting and remote hearings so members of Congress have to show up at work to do the people’s business, just like every American does each day. Next, the rules will open up the amendment process so more members can get involved in shaping and improving legislation. It will also re-implement the 2/3 supermajority requirement on votes to raise taxes, finally bringing back fiscal sanity after years of the Democrats’ inflation fueling tax and spend agenda. With these rules in place, the House will at last be able to get to work to provide needed oversight of the Biden Administration, address the crisis at the southern border, and face our strategic competition against the Chinese Communist Party head-on. This bill passed the House by a vote of 220-213.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 23, the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act. Last year, to fund their left-wing agenda, Democrats in Congress decided to spend billions of dollars on 87,000 new IRS Agents to increase audits on ordinary Americans. While the Biden Administration may claim this will only affect high-income earners, the truth is that their tax revenue projections only work if they target all hardworking Americans. The CBO has agreed with this, finding that these additional agents will lead to as many as 700,000 more audits on Americans making less than $75,00 a year. We need a simpler tax code, a leaner bureaucracy, and a more effective IRS that serves the needs of the taxpayers instead of preying on them. This legislation defunds the Democrats’ reckless, expansive and unaccountable expansion of the IRS to stand up for hardworking taxpayers. This bill passed the House by a vote of 221-210.</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>December 23, 2022</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 2617, the bloated and inflation fueling omnibus government funding bill for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23). I opposed the bill for many reasons, including several of the bill’s wasteful spending provisions and anti-Second Amendment measures. The bill also failed to address inflation, fix the crisis at our border, or expand American energy exploration. Among the many faults of the bill it hires only 300 Border Patrol agents and reduces the capacity of ICE detention centers, spends $2.4 billion to house illegal immigrants without appropriating any money to building the border wall, and it spends millions to encourage states to enact unconstitutional “red flag” laws. It is time to bring fiscal sanity back to congress so we can finally bring wage-killing inflation under control. This bill passed the House by a vote of 225-201 with 1 member voting present. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>December 22, 2022</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 9640, the Presidential Tax Filings and Audit Transparency Act. This legislation is nothing more than a ploy by House Democrats to get media attention and claim to the public that their six year witch-hunt of former President Trump produced some sort of results for the American people. This bill passed the House by a vote of 222-201. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act. While I support National Heritage Areas and many portions of this legislation, such a massive reform of this program and the over $700 million in authorized spending should of gone through a full markup in the House Natural Resources Committee. Unfortunately, the House did not do this full diligence and instead decided to take up the Senate version of this legislation. I look forward working in the next Congress to strengthen this program and associated taxpayer protections. This bill passed the House by a vote of 326-95. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 3773, a bill to authorize the lease of up to 99 years for land held in trust for the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation. <em><span>This legislation </span></em><span><span>would make a technical amendment to the Long-Term Leasing Act of 1955, which states that Tribes cannot lease out their land for more than 25 years (with one option to renew the lease for another 25 years). It would extend that lease period to 99 years for the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation.</span></span> The Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation are currently fielding multiple development proposals along I-5 to serve supply chain needs, but they cannot act on these proposals because the prospective lessees and their private financiers require lease terms of at least 50 years. Allowing these leases will boost economic activity and tax revenue in the area that will benefit all local residents. This bill passed the House by a vote of 377-42.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on S. 4104, the Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act. This legislation will allow the tribe to take additional land into trust, depriving the other local residents of a say in how this land is used and managed. It will also effectively subsidize the local profitable tourism businesses run by the tribe. If we are going to spend taxpayer money to boost these tribal businesses, this bill should have had a full hearing and review in the House Natural Resources Committee. This bill passed the House by a vote of 360-55.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on S. 5087, a bill to Amend the Not Divisible Act of 2019. This legislation would extend a cross jurisdictional advisory committee that is redundant of existing efforts within the Department of Interior and Department of Justice. If these two departments are not adequately combatting an epidemic of missing persons, murder, and trafficking of Native Americans and Alaska Natives then we need to execute immediate congressional oversight over these two departments. Our solution to incompetence should not be to create redundant bureaucracy at the expense of the taxpayer. This bill passed the House by a vote of 374-44.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on S. 989, the Native American Language Resource Center Act. This legislation would use millions in taxpayer dollars to create a network of Native American Language Resource Centers around the country. I am supportive of Native Americans continuing their cultural heritage, but this type of work should not require such a large public subsidy on top of the already extensive allocation of resources that the federal government spends in this area. This bill passed the House by a vote of 342-71. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on S. 1402, the Durbin Feeling Native American Languages Act.<em><span><span><span> This</span></span></span></em><span><span> bill would authorize $1.5 million dollars a year to fund an annual study to improve federal agencies’ coordination in support of Native American languages. It would also authorize a federal survey of Native language use and programmatic needs every five years. These surveys will serve as “health checks” to allow Native communities and Congress to target federal resources for Native American languages more effectively. The primary concern with this program is that it funds additional money to do oversight the federal government should be performing already. If these federal agencies are unwilling to review their own processes and effectiveness, it is apparent that oversight of these agencies must be a top priority for the next congress before more funding is spent. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 337-79.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 7939, the Student Veteran Emergency Relief Act. This bill would authorize the VA to pay additional education and training benefits to veterans negatively impacted by emergency situations. The bill also expands eligibility for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits to those veterans who receive sole survivorship discharges. Professional licenses would also be made portable for military spouses so they can continue working while they are stationed with their spouse. This important legislation extends GI Bill flexibilities that were established by Congress for COVID-19 to all emergencies, ensuring our heroes can continue to have access to their benefits. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 380-35.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>December 21st, 2022</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />

That is why this bill will require </span><span><span><span>that all athletes representing the United States in global athletic competitions, including the men’s and women’s World Cup tournaments, receive equal compensation and benefits in their sport.

Over the past two years, our nation has been burdened with record high energy prices. Lowering energy costs depends both on adequate production and a smoothly functioning energy transport market. However, when a crude oil, liquid natural gas, or chemical ship becomes compromised, the complex and time consuming process of lightering is required to transport the cargo to another ship and prevent a spill. To reduce red tape for this necessary process, this bill will amend C and D visa categories to allow nonimmigrant and conditional permits to be granted for up to 180 days to foreign crewmembers of lightering ships. This bill passed the House by a vote of 394-19.</span></span></span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> <span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 4926, the Respect for Child Survivors Act. During the FBI investigations of Larry Nassar, a doctor for the US women’s gymnastics team who assaulted dozens of women and young girls, the FBI agents involved have been accused of performing additional emotional harm on the victims due to their inability to adequately respond to their trauma. In response, this bill will improve the process of FBI agents dealing with child victims and witnesses by requiring trauma-informed experts to be a part of any interview of a victim reporting child abuse or trafficking to the FBI. No child should be put in this awful position again.

I voted “Yes” on S. 3168, a bill to amend the White Mount Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to modify enforceability dates for certain powers. The bill will help ensure access to safe, reliable drinking water for Tribal members on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, including Whiteriver, Fort Apache, Canyon Day, Cedar Creek, Carrizo, and Cibecue. It indexes the allowable costs of the WMAT rural water system to inflation to account for cost increases. The bill will also amend the Tribe’s water rights settlement that was enacted by Congress in 2010 by extending the time needed to complete the White Mountain Apache Rural Water System and Miner Flat Dam project, which has run longer than anticipated due to technical delays.

Historically, the tribe has diverted 90% of their water entitlement and this legislation would set up a established process for these agreements. The bill was drafted with robust local input and with collaboration with the Arizona Department of Water Resources, the United States Government, and the Colorado River Indian Tribes.

I voted “Yes” on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 7535, the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act. Although still in its developing stages, the creation of quantum computing has shown the potential to radically improve our computing capacity by reducing the computing time for some calculations from years to mere minutes or even seconds. A great deal of the research into this new technology is occurring right here in upstate New York at the Air Force Research Lab in Rome, New York. However, this increased capacity also brings the risk of allowing bad actors to easily override the algorithms and encryption methods that currently secure most of our digital data.  This bill with help mitigate national security risks, requiring the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a rule or binding guidance related to the migration of Executive Branch cryptographic systems to post-quantum cryptography. These are the types of necessary steps we must take to keep the data of Americans safe. This bill passed the House by a vote of 420-3.<br /><br /><strong>December 12, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.1466, the Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Program Act of 2021. This bipartisan legislation authorizes the U.S. Geological Survey to perform a study in coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS) and other federal, state, tribal, and local agencies, research universities, non-profits, and other partners in order to assess and conserve saline lake ecosystems. Throughout the mountain west, saline lakes and their associated wetlands form an integral part of the local ecosystem, providing a home for a diverse range of wildlife. These habitats also provide irreplaceable recreational and hunting opportunities for their local communities. It is important we act to ensure these wetlands are still healthy and thriving for future generations. This bill passed the House by a vote of 356-56.<br /><br /><strong>December 8, 2022</strong><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on the Senate amendment to H.R. 7776, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. The National Defense Authorization Act is key to America’s security—that is exactly why Congress has now passed it for the 62nd consecutive year. The bill includes $45 billion more than was requested by President Biden, and it stops his harmful cuts to the construction of battle force ships as well as his proposed reductions to the procurement of new combat vehicles, missiles, and much more. The legislation contains important provisions to counter China and our adversaries across the globe. It also delivers for our servicemembers and their families by revoking the vaccine mandate, providing our troops with a much needed 4.6% pay raise, and including $500 million for additional housing allowances to counter record inflation under President Biden. I am especially pleased that two of my amendments made it into the bill, including one requiring a report on the U.N. arms embargo and its effectiveness in constraining Iran's ability to supply, sell, or transfer arms or related material. The FY23 NDAA will provide for a strong, robust military and enhance America’s national security for decades to come. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 350-80.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act. I firmly believe that every marriage entered into between two consenting adults deserves to be honored, respected, and protected. Same-sex marriages sanctioned by the state should be recognized by the government and duly protected. Before today, following the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell, same-sex marriage was already recognized and protected. The Supreme Court indicated as recently as 2022, that this status is not under threat. Unfortunately, while this bill sought to codify aspects of the Obergefell decision, it did so by failing to include sufficiently explicit religious liberty protections. The private right of action included in this legislation is overly broad and could be abused by trial attorneys to target those with deeply held religious beliefs. Amendments that would have clarified and improved upon this language were sadly rejected. Americans with deeply held religious beliefs and faith-based organizations deserve legal certainty, and this bill fell short of providing them that. Free speech and the right to practice one’s faith are fundamental rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. My opposition to this legislation stems from the fundamental need for stronger protections for religious Americans so that the rights of all individuals acting in good-faith are protected equally. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 258-169 with 1 member voting "Present".</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 1617, the Disaster Assistance for Rural Communities Act. Due to flaws in current law, small businesses and homeowners in rural communities often face bureaucratic red tape when accessing Small Business Administration (SBA) natural disaster assistance. In response, this legislation creates a waiver at no cost, allowing rural communities facing a presidentially-declared disaster to reach the assistance and resources they need. Federal inefficiencies should not be in the way of Americans receiving the relief they need to get back on their feet. This bill passed the House by a vote of 406-8.</span></span><br /><br /><strong>December 6, 2022</strong> <br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 7946, the Veteran Service Recognition Act. This bill would create a path to citizenship for veterans, military service members, and their family members who are in the United States illegally or have committed other removable offenses, have received due process in a U.S. immigration court and were ordered to be removed by an immigration judge. Serving in our military is among the most honorable acts of service one can perform in defense of our country and its values. Unfortunately, this legislation goes too far by extending admission to almost all non-citizens who have served in the military without regard for why they were removed. This could include some who were removed from the country for serious offenses and could put Americans and our national security at risk. As the Biden administration’s failure to secure the border continues, this legislation would give Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas the ability to “exercise discretion” in almost every case. Secretary Mayorkas has been an utter failure, and in the midst of the worst immigration crisis in recent history, the last thing Congress should be doing is giving this man more discretion. The American people deserve better to make our country safer. This bill passed the House by a vote of 213-207.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on Suspensions En Bloc. This package included bills such as S. 1617, the Disaster Assistance for Rural Communities Act, H.R. 8844, the STEP Improvement Act, and S.1687, the Small Business Development Center Cyber Training Act. These bills will roll back bureaucratic red tape in disaster response, strengthen the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) to support small business exports, and improve cybersecurity training for small businesses. This En Bloc passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 380-46.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 4052, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act. This bill would reauthorize through 2027 the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is a grant program that’s administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and awards funding to states to support programs for screening and intervention of newborns and children with hearing deficits. The EDHI program has been one of the most important programs for individuals with hearing deficits, and this will ensure continued success of early intervention services. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 408-17<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3462, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act. Over the past few years, the federal government, including the Small Business Administration (SBA), has been the target of cyber-attacks, some of which have successfully undermined the privacy of Americans. This bill would require the SBA to produce an annual report on its information technology (IT) and cybersecurity infrastructure. The report would need to include a strategy on increasing cybersecurity infrastructure, an account of equipment manufactured by Chinese companies, and an account of cybersecurity incidents at the SBA within the past previous two years. The new Senate text further improves the bill by requiring the SBA to report on supply chain risk management strategy and a plan to address the risked for foreign manufactured technology used by the Administration. This bill passed the House by a vote of 417-0. <br />
 <br />
I voted “No” on S. 3875, the Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act. This bill would require FEMA to designate areas that are highly susceptible to natural disasters as community disaster relief zones. This bill would also increase the federal cost-share for projects in designated community disaster relief zones from 75 percent to 90 percent. While I believe that the federal government should assist communities destroyed by natural disasters, I oppose this bill’s focus on “social vulnerabilities”, which considers unrelated demographic information such as race, ethnicity, and minority status when determining community disaster relief zones, ultimately distracting from core issues such as damage and recovery. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 333-92.</p><p>I voted “Yes” on S. 3499, To amend the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to repeal certain obsolete requirements. This bill would repeal Section 692 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which requires DHS to minimize the use of subcontractors for work pertaining to the response and recovery from natural disasters. When recovering and responding to natural disasters, government agencies should always take the most cost effective and efficient course of action, including using subcontractors when appropriate. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 424-1.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 2796, the Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention Act. This bill would expand the allowable uses for grants under the Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Program (COSSAP). It would permit the COSSAP program to provide grants to community response programs in rural areas focusing on reducing opioid overdose deaths. Community response programs receiving funding under this bill would be tasked with identifying gaps in prevention, treatment, and recovery services. As the opioid crisis continues to devastate communities across upstate New York and throughout America, this legislation will help tackle the problem and provide Americans with the care they need. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 408-11.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on the PROTECT Our Children Act. This bill would authorize appropriations of $60 million for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024 to carry out the National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction which includes the National Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force program, which encourages multi-jurisdictional and multiagency responses to crimes against children involving the internet. Congress must take meaningful action to protect children online, and this is a positive step toward that goal. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 421-1.</p><p>I voted “No” on H.R. 5796, the well-meaning but misguided Patents for Humanity Act. This bill would create a competition administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that would award certificates to entities that have submitted an application for a patent that would address a humanitarian issue. Certificates could be redeemed to accelerate certain processes at the USPTO. While it is great that this bill encourages innovation in the humanitarian space, it ignores the fact that for years the USPTO has been giving out invalid patents that infringe on other previous patents. This administrative failure opens up the patent to becoming later overturned in the courts or Patent Trial and Appeal Board. It therefore does nothing more than add additional cost and confusion for all involved parties. In response, it is important that we act to improve the patent office and find other ways to benefit humanity. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 396-24.<br /><br /><strong>December 2, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 8876, the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act of 2022. This bipartisan legislation extends and modifies the existing Maternal, Infant, and Childhood Visiting (MIECHV) Program to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The grants help fund home visiting programs to support expecting mothers and parents of young children who live in committees with greater risks and barriers to achieving positive maternal and child health outcomes. To help improve the program, this legislation will boost oversight so that policy makers can more effectively shape the program to advance positive health results. It will also reduce bureaucracy for participating organizations and increase buy in from states so they have greater encouragement to ensuring these funds are effectively spent. Finally, the bill will increase funding for every state so they can have more resources to care for mothers and children. It is vital that we cultivate a society that respects the value and potential in every life. This important legislation is a positive step towards achieving this goal. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 390-26.<br /><br /><strong>December 1, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4785, the Uyghur Policy Act. This bill supports a comprehensive, multilateral approach to addressing Uyghur issues and push back on the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) efforts to silence Uyghur advocacy. It would direct the State Department to create the United States Special Coordinator for Uyghur Issues. The bill would authorize $250,000 in appropriations for FY22-FY24 to have Uyghur human rights advocates speak at international forums under the U.S. Speaker Program. The bill would also direct the State Department to offer Uyghur language training to Foreign Service officers and work to assign officers who speak Uyghur to diplomatic missions in China. Millions of Uyghurs and other ethnic minority groups residing in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) have been the victims of genocide and the PRC’s “reeducation” campaign. The United States needs a far more coordinated strategy to further raise the atrocities in XUAR on the global stage, push back against the PRC’s campaign of disinformation and coercion, and effectively respond to the human rights abuses taking place. This bill is one step in the right direction. This bill passed the House by a vote of 407-17.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on Suspensions En Bloc #1. This package included bills such as H.R. 4601, the Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach Act, H.R. 4772, the Mark O’Brien VA Clothing Allowance Improvement Act, and H.R. 7158, the Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act. These bills would help ensure that the VA carries out its duty to ensure important veterans benefits are accessible to those who have earned them and that our veterans receive the proper medical care they deserve. This en bloc passed the House by a vote of 401-18.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on Suspensions En Bloc #2. This package included bills to designate certain United States Postal Service locations after veterans and former members of Congress who served their communities and country. One bill, H.R. 4988, would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 10 Broadway Street West, in Akeley, Minnesota, as the “Neal Kenneth Todd Post Office. Mr. Kenneth was tragically killed in action during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while serving on the U.S.S. Oklahoma. This en bloc passed the House by a vote of 350-66, with 2 abstentions.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2521, the DOULA for VA Act of 2022. This bill would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study on the feasibility of furnishing doula services to pregnant veterans who receive health care through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA). This study could help expand access to services for pregnant veterans, who are disproportionately impacted by mental health issues, and ensure better outcomes for veteran mothers and their children. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 376-44.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 231, the Protection Firefighters from Adverse Substances (PFAS) Act. Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that are used in various consumer products, such as carpets, non-stick cookware, water repellent clothing, and firefighting foam. Some studies have suggested that sustained exposure to some of these chemicals can result in negative health effects. In response, this bill will require the Department of Homeland Security to develop and publish guidance and best practices for firefighters and emergency responders to reduce their exposure to PFAS. They put their lives on the line to protect us and it is our responsibility to ensure they are safe and healthy. This bill passed the House by a vote of 400-22.<br />
 <br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 3115, the POWER 2.0 Act. This legislation would require the Chief Judge in each judicial district to hold at least one public event a year to promote pro bono legal services. The aim is to empower survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. It is a reasonable policy change to help these survivors and ensure they are aware of and can access free legal services. This bill passed the House by a vote of 406-14.<br /><strong> <br />

I voted “No” on H.J.Res. 100, To provide for a resolution with respect to the unresolved disputes between certain railroads represented by the National Carriers’ Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and certain of their employees. This resolution would impose the tentative agreement between railroad companies and railway unions, regardless of whether they were ratified or rejected by each union. After President Biden failed to negotiate a new contract between the railroad companies and railway workers, he asked Congress to undermine the rights of these workers and impose his negotiated deal. Rank and file union members rejected this deal, and this resolution ignored their opposition to this deal. While it is important to avoid a rail strike, this should be accomplished by good-faith negotiations, not by Congress imposing a deal supported by union bosses and railroad companies, but opposed by rank-and-file railway union members. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 290-137.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.Con.Res. 119, Providing for a correction in the enrollment of H.J. Res. 100. This bill would amend the tentative agreement between railroad companies and railway unions to include seven paid days of sick leave. Instead of allowing the railway unions and companies to return to the negotiating table to amicably negotiate a new contract, Congress chose to impose the agreement rejected by the rank-and-file union members and make this change to the agreement. This is exactly the opposite approach that Congress should have taken. I believe both the rank-and-file railway workers and railroad companies should have continued negotiating a deal that both sides accept. By changing the deal, this disincentivizes dealmaking in future negotiation processes, and instead incentivizes both parties to simply have Congress impose the provisions that they support, the opposite of how the process should work. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 221-207.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>November 29, 2022 </strong><br />
I <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>voted “No” on S. 4003, the Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act of 2022. Every day, our brave law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to protect our communities. I will always fight to ensure they have the resources, training, and support to protect and serve with honor and integrity. Sadly, over the years, radicals on the left have acted to undermine officers’ safety and ability to do their jobs effectively. This legislation is yet another example of this dangerous trend. While it may be well-intentioned, practically speaking, this bill will require the Attorney General to create new federal policing standards that could then be used by the Biden Administration as a means of micromanaging and weakening our law enforcement agencies. These powers belong with our states and local governments, not with Washington bureaucrats. This bill failed in the House by a vote of 247-160-1.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on the House Amendment to S. 3846, the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Reauthorization Act. As a compassionate society, we have a responsibility to ensure our fellow Americans suffering with mental illness have the resources they need to seek help and recover. To help achieve this aim, this important bill will reform Department of Justice JMHCP grants to ensure they better address mental health calls, suicide prevention, increased prosecutor training on diversion programs, services to reduce recidivism and help with reentry, increased treatment capacity of mental health and substance abuse disorders, and to support enhanced integration of the 988 hotline. This bill passed the House by a vote of 389-22</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 5455, the Terry Technical Correction Act. </span></span><span>Over the past several <span>years</span>, <span>radical activists on the left have focused their attention on pro-criminal policies that have made our families and communities less safe. </span>As someone who supported President Trump’s First Step Act in 2018, I believe right now when <span>our nation is suffering from a</span>n unprecedented <span>crime crisis</span>, we should<span> instead be focusing on legislation that supports our law enforcement </span>officers,<span> enhances public safety</span>, and holds those who break the law fully accountable for their actions<span>.

I <span>voted “Yes” on Suspensions En Bloc, which included measures such as H.R. 7277, the Improving Oversight of the Veterans Community Care Providers Act, H.R. 7299, the SVAC Act, and H.R. 4275, the Ensuring Phone and Internet Access Through Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity Program Act of 2022. This en bloc passed by a vote of 381-39.</span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on S. 3369, the Max Cleland VA Medical Center Act. This bill would designate the medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, as the “Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center”. I am grateful for Lieutenant Cleland’s brave service and sacrifice in the Army during the Vietnam War as part of the 1st Cavalry Division. However, I continue to believe that government buildings, such as VA medical centers and post offices, should not be named after partisan politicians, including Cleland. As a U.S. Senator from Georgia, Cleland was stanchly pro-choice and voted against banning abortions on military bases, voted against banning partial birth abortions, and voted against prohibiting U.S. military hospitals and medical facilities from performing privately funded abortions for U.S. service members and their dependents. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 359-62</span></span><span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 4359, the Senator Johnny Isakson VA Regional Office Act.<strong> </strong>This bill would designate the regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, as the “Senator Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office”. Mr. Isakson served in the Georgia Air National Guard and chaired the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, where he worked to expand healthcare choices for veterans and advocated for bipartisan education reforms that ultimately became the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 418-2</span></span><span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2250, the Department of Veterans Affairs Information Technology Reform Act. This bill<strong> </strong>would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from spending funds on new major IT projects unless it first submits a report to Congress detailing cost estimates, timelines, and performance objectives for such major projects. The bill would also require the VA to regularly update this report to Congress with certain deviations in the cost, schedule, or performance of major IT projects. The VA would have to annually submit a review of its IT portfolio to Congress, and all VA major IT projects would have to be managed by interdisciplinary teams that meet a specified list of qualifications. It would also move oversight and management of the VA’s Financial Services Center’s IT systems under the purview of the VA’s Chief Information Officer. The bill would require the VA to list all of its active IT projects in the VA’s annual budget justification to Congress, including a prioritized list of unfunded IT projects. Altogether, this legislation will improve information technology (IT) systems and management at the VA. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 414-2.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3630, the Lymphedema Treatment Act, of which I am an original cosponsor. Lymphedema is a chronic disease that results in a buildup of excess lymph fluid in the body. This swelling can be reduced through the use of compression garments, which drain the excess fluid. To expand access to this treatment, this legislation will require Medicare to cover 80 percent of the cost of these garments. This bill passed the House by a vote of 402-13.</span></span><span><span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>November 16, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on S. 4524, the Speak Out Act.  All forms of assault or harassment are wrong and perpetrators should always be held accountable. This is why all non-disclosure agreements will allow victims to report these crimes in good faith to law enforcement. However, this legislation does nothing to hold culprits legally responsible and instead undermines employers’ ability to keep their business details confidential. It will automatically nullify a non-disclosure agreement and non-disparagement clause once there has been an accusation of sexual assault or harassment, even if the claim had not been investigated or substantiated. In addition, the bill will federalize contract law and unduly interfere with Americans’ freedom to contract. Finally, to justify the need for the bill, the text cites a far-left UC San Diego study that includes instances of “misgendering” in its statistics on sexual harassment.  The inclusion of this statistic is wholly unserious and demonstrates the ultimate social engineering goal of these policies, driven by woke politics and not a genuine need to provide for victims of abuse or harassment. This bill passed the House by a vote of 315-109.<br /><br /><strong>November 14, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5441, the PAST Act of 2021, of which I am an original cosponsor. As a lifelong pet owner, animal lover, and horse rider, I know the special place that pets and wildlife have in our homes and societies. It is important that we do our part to protect defenseless animals. This bill amends the 1970 Horse Protection Act to strengthen penalties against the soring of horses and ban devices required in the soring process. These devices can often cause tendon and joint damage to a horse, resulting in large amounts of pain and discomfort. It is critical that we finally end this cruel practice and hold all violators responsible. This bill passed the House by a vote of 304-111. <br /><br /><strong>September 30, 2022</strong><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 8987, the Fairness for 9/11 Families Act. This bill would authorize catch-up payments for 9/11 victims, spouses, and dependents who became newly eligible to receive payments from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (USVSST) in 2019. Previously, only non-dependent siblings and parents received payments. The bill would rescind $2.982 billion in unspent COVID relief funds to offset the cost of the payments. Importantly, this legislation helps bring justice to the victims, spouses, and dependents who were left out originally and will allow them to receive payments that match those received by other family members. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 400-31.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 6833, the Continuing Appropriations and Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, also known as the Continuing Resolution. This Continuing Resolution failed to meaningfully address any of the crises that are hammering New Yorkers, which is why I strongly opposed it. The bill does nothing to rein in reckless spending or tackle runaway inflation. It fails to take any action to secure the Southern Border or protect middle-income Americans from Biden’s IRS audits. The Continuing Resolution ignores the root causes of our energy crisis and fails to unleash American energy production to lower prices for consumers. And it fails to crush the flow of deadly opioids that are a scourge on our communities. I remain committed to delivering what the American people are demanding: an economy that is strong, a nation that is safe, a future that is built on freedom, and a government that is accountable to the people. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 230-201.<br /><br /><strong>September 29, 2022</strong></span></span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 7780, the Mental Health Matters Act. This bill would provide grant funding to state and local education agencies to implement mental health interventions, facilitate partnerships between school districts and higher education institutions, recruit and retain mental health service providers, and connect school districts with local trauma-informed support and mental health systems. Unfortunately, while well-intentioned, this bill contains harmful provisions that could ultimately drive the cost of mental health coverage through the roof, causing employers to drop mental health coverage in order to avoid costly litigation. It also neglects to prioritize the importance of families and the broader community when dealing with mental health challenges and could further isolate children from their parents and other community support structures. Further, the legislation authorizes more spending, despite the fact that schools received approximately $190 billion in COVID-19 relief funding already, portions of which remains unspent. In addition, we still do not truly understand the extent to which COVID-related lockdownshurt our students and exacerbated mental health issues, something which we should firmly understand first so we can target any new federal spending. Our communities desperately need access to mental health care, which is why I co-led the REACHING Improved Mental Health Outcomes for Patients Act earlier this year to reauthorize and strengthen important mental health programs. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-205.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 4900, the SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs play an important role in ensuring federal research and commercialization efforts go to our nation’s small businesses and startups. This bill will reauthorize these programs through 2025 and make critical updates. First, it will bolster research security to ensure awardees are not under the influence of China or other foreign actors. Second, it will improve reporting requirements to strengthen Congressional oversight, increase public transparency, and safeguard taxpayer dollars. Last, it will add enhanced performance benchmarks for small businesses that have won multiple SBIR &amp; STTR awards. This will ensure these awardees are focused on commercializing projects and fully leveraging their federal grant money. With these improvements we will ensure the American people receive the full benefits from these programs. This bill passed the House by a vote of 415-9.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R.8466, the Chai Suthammanont Healthy Federal Workplaces Act of 2022. During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the haphazard federal response undermined the well-being of federal employees and the efficient functioning of federal services. This bill will require all agencies to submit a plan for future public health emergencies and incorporate lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is vital we do not repeat the same mistakes again. This bill passed the House by a vote of 351-73.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.3470, the End Human Trafficking in Government Contracts Act of 2022, which will update the procedures by which the federal government responds to human trafficking reports. Currently, if agencies receive an inspector general report substantiating a claim of human trafficking from a contractor or grantee, the agency has the discretion to initiate contract suspension. This legislation will require them to refer the matter to an agency official with contact suspension or debarment authority. This bill passed the House by a vote of 423-0. </span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.2551, the AI Training Act, which will develop and implement an Artificial Intelligence (AI) training program for certain non-defense federal employees. This will allow these federal workers responsible for program management, research and testing, contracting, and logistics to learn more about the potential benefits and pitfalls of AI technology. This bill passed the House by a vote of 393-29.</span></span><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 6955, the Visit America Act, as amended. This bill establishes a new Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism position to promote U.S. travel and tourism. However, unfortunately, this bill also includes many policies related to the far-left’s woke agenda under the guise of tourism, needlessly turning this into a highly partisan position. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 325-93.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 7321, the Global Aircraft Maintenance Safety Improvement Act. This bill would add new regulations and oversight requirements to foreign aircraft repair stations. However, these new regulations will force domestic air carriers to raise prices even further at a time when costs are already soaring. While I support ensuring the safety of aircraft, these new regulations are unnecessary and overly burdensome on domestic air carriers. This issue could have been and should have been addressed in a more targeted and thoughtful manner. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 374-52.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 3662, the Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act. This bill would temporarily allow the federal government to cover 100 percent of the cost for airports to purchase and deploy aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) input-based testing equipment. This important legislation will increase access to testing devices that limit PFAS exposure, reducing the spread of toxic per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at commercial airports. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 381-42.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 8888, the Food Security for All Veterans Act. This bill would establish the Office of Food Security within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which would be responsible for informing veterans of federal food assistance programs, collaborating with the VA Homeless Programs Office to implement policies to identify and treat food insecure veterans, collaborating with the Department of Agriculture to develop materials related to Transition Assistance Program curriculum, developing training for social workers, chaplains, and dietitians on how to enroll veterans in federal food assistance programs, and issuing guidance on collaboration with state and local food assistance programs. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 376-49.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 2794, the Supporting Families of the Fallen Act. This bill would increase from $400,000 to $500,000 the automatic maximum coverage amounts for life insurance programs for active service members and veterans. These coverage amounts have not been updated since 2005. Amid record inflation, this legislation will ensure veterans can better provide for their families with stability and peace of mind. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 425-0.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 8446, the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act of 2022, as amended. This bill would reauthorize funding for the Global Food Security Strategy and for international disaster relief programs, including the emergency Food Security Program. This bill would promote critical food security, nutrition programs, and resilience in developing nations consistent with U.S. national security interests. This legislation comes at a pivotal time of global food insecurity, especially as Russia’s war in Ukraine exacerbates the food crisis. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 331-95.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 8463, the Millennium Challenge Corporation Eligibility Expansion Act. This bill would expand the number of eligible countries for assistance from the Millennium Challenge Corporation. As China’s global malign influence continues to rise through the Belt and Road Initiative, the United States must do more to provide an alternative. This bill allows more countries to receive targeted U.S. investment over Chinese aid, and would prevent more countries from accepting predatory Chinese loans. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 334-87.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on Suspensions En Bloc (H.R. 8956, H.R. 6967, H.R. 8163, H.R. 4081, H.R. 6889, H.R. 1638, Senate Amendment to H.R. 5641, H.R. 3304, H.R. 8875, S.1198, H.R. 8510, H.R. 8681, and H.R. 4821). This en bloc contained various problematic bills, including legislation that was never subject to a hearing in advance of markup, where legislation could have been debated and more information could have been gleaned with respect to its effects. This package of legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 296-127.</span></span><span><span><br /><br /><strong>September 28, 2022</strong></span></span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3482, the National Center for the Advancement of Aviation Act. This bill would establish the National Center for the Advancement of Aviation, which would be a federally-chartered private entity. The purpose of the center would be to develop the U.S. aviation and aerospace workforce, support collaboration between government and private actors in the field and serve as a source of research in the field of aviation. This center will allow these sectors to coordinate, promote, and support the future of aviation, and it will ensure the U.S. remains a leader in aviation. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 369-56.</span></span><br /><br /><strong>September 22, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6448, the Invest to Protect Act. We have countless small police departments across </span></span><span>u<span>pstate New York </span>that<span> suffer from a lack of resources and an inability to attract and retain officers</span>. These problems have been driven by bad policies in Albany like cashless bail as well as the radical Defund the Police movement<span>. This bill creates a new grant program at the Department of Justice </span>(DOJ) <span>focused on improving the recruitment and retention of local law enforcement </span>officers <span>and providing </span>expanded <span>training and access to mental health resources. To be eligible, law enforcement agencies must employ fewer than 125 office</span>r<span>s, a threshold </span>that<span> will cover more than 95 percent of police departments in the country</span> and the vast majority of police departments in New York’s 22nd Congressional District<span>. All grants awarded as part of this new program are subject to </span>strict <span>audit by the DOJ Inspector General, and </span>the bill mandates<span> reimbursement for </span>any <span>unauthorized use of funds. </span>This<span> federal </span>program will build on other successful programs like it that have provided much-needed resources to local police and fire departments, including the SAFER grant program. It will ensure that our police departments and communities do not continue to suffer as a result of the far-left Defund the Police movement<span>. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 360-64.</span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. </span></span><span>8542<span>, the Mental Health </span>Justice<span> Act. This legislation</span><span>is</span> unfortunately<span> yet another part of the Democrats' anti-police agenda</span>, which attempts <span>to reimagine law enforcement in the United States as we know it</span> in a way that will make our communities less safe<span>. As crime skyrockets in communities across the country, this bill provides no further resources for law enforcement but instead looks to replace police with </span>individuals who are less equipped to address the immediate threat of violent crime<span>. </span>We absolutely must continue to invest in mental health services, but this bill falls short by deemphasizing the need to expand the presence of law enforcement officers in our communities and by including requirements that could actually encourage failed policies like cashless bail, which has wreaked complete havoc throughout New York. Mental health professionals are absolutely part of the answer when it comes to expanding services to mentally ill individuals, and they should work alongside police, instead of replacing them as this bill would encourage. <span>This bill passed the House <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>of Representatives </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>by a vote of 223-206.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 4118</span></span><span>, the Break the Cycle of Violence Act<span>. </span>This bill would award<span> new grants to community organizers instead of focusing resources on funding police</span>. Unfortunately, <span>H.R. 4118 is another example of Democrats attempting to radically reconfigure how law enforcement operates across the country</span> in a manner that will not make our communities safer<span>. Th</span>e<span> new office of Community Violence Prevention and grant program </span>created by the bill <span>will have an enormous budget of $700 million per year </span>but are based on a funding <span>model that has failed in countless communities</span> already<span>. Overall, this legislation’s </span>high price tag and <span>embrace of failed policies is </span>ill-conceived and not the best use of taxpayer funds at a time of high crime. Instead, we should be focused on targeted measures that support law enforcement<span>. This bill passed the House <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>of Representatives</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> by a vote 220-207.</span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 5768, the VICTIM Act. It is important that law enforcement has the resources it needs to investigate all crimes so they can hold all criminals accountable. </span></span><span>Unfortunately, after<span> decades of disinvestment</span> in several cities, <span>many departments now have a large backlog of unsolved cases and untested rape kits. Th</span>is problem requires a comprehensive solution starting with states and local governments to break the cycle rather than throwing more federal taxpayer money at the problem. Unfortunately, this bill fails to require states to make necessary and long-term changes that would reduce backlogs over time and instead funds a system that is clearing already falling short, simply perpetuating a problem rather than solving it. Republican amendments that were offered to make this bill more accountable to the taxpayers were regrettably rejected by Democrats.  <span>While this legislation may be well-intentioned, at a cost of $1 billion over the next ten years, it fails to make the kind of systemic changes we need to correct the very issues that led to the problems in the first place. This bill passed the House <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>of Representatives</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> by a vote of 250-178. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>September 21, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 8873, the Presidential Election Reform Act. The partisan Presidential Election Reform Act is the latest attempt from House Democrats to stack the democratic process in their favor. House Democrats rushed this bill through the House of Representatives in a highly partisan manner without any legitimate input from Republicans. The bill text was introduced only days before tonight’s vote, and the bill never received a bipartisan hearing or markup in the committee of jurisdiction. The reason this bill did not go through the legislative process is because it is not a serious attempt to legislate by House Democrats. It is nothing more than a partisan messaging bill intended to score cheap political points weeks before an election. Not only was this bill drafted with bad intentions, but it is also poor policy. The bill broadly defines a ‘catastrophic event,’ which could be used to extend balloting for up to five days after the polls close in a presidential election. It also tramples on the core principle of state sovereignty and directly contradicts the United States Constitution. The legislation also creates broad private rights of action in a backdoor effort to empower Democrat election lawyers and partisan operatives. If the Democrat majority in the House was serious about election integrity, it would take a cue from the House Election Integrity Caucus and focus on priorities that actually enhance the security and transparency of our elections. We should take up my bill to ban Zuckerbucks, hold states accountable for their failure to retain records under the Civil Rights Act of 1960, stop President Biden from implementing an overreaching Executive Order turning federal agencies into partisan voting operations, and provide states with tools and resources to boost election security. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 229-203.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on <span>S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act</span><span>. This bill would allow a currently or previously married couple to apply to have a joint consolidated loan split into two separate Federal Direct Loans, creating a new authority for the Department of Education to separate joint consolidation loans. S. 1098 passed the Senate by unanimous consent in June with the intent to allow for joint consolidated loans to be separated. However, since its passage in the Senate, the Biden Administration has used an emergency declaration to unconstitutionally cancel student loan debts, costing taxpayers as much as $1 trillion. House Republicans support efforts for joint borrowers to separate their loans in an expeditious manner, but this legislation goes beyond that by giving the Education Secretary broadened power for additional loan forgiveness under President Biden’s unconstitutional student loan forgiveness policy, completely bypassing congressional approval. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 232-193.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>September 20, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 2490, the Blackwell School National Historic Site Act.<strong> </strong>This bill would establish the Blackwell School National Historic Site in Texas as a unit of the National Park System (NPS). This would preserve, protect, and interpret for the benefit of present and future generations the Blackwell School, its role as both an academic and cultural cornerstone in Marfa, TX, and its function within a segregated education system from 1885-1965. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 414-12.<br /><br /><strong>September 19, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 1456, the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act of 2022, as amended. This bill reauthorizes the Peace Corps through FY24 and boosts volunteers’ worker’s compensation benefits and readjustment benefits. I had concerns regarding this bill that were unfortunately not addressed in the amendment process. First, the bill would increase some benefits given to Peace Corps volunteers, while other federal volunteer positions are not set receive any increase at all. Further, this benefit raise is so large that the benefits of some in the federal workforce would be less than Peace Corps volunteers’ benefits, raising serious cost and fairness concerns at a time of record-high inflation. Additionally, this bill does not sufficiently address the sexual assault risks that exist for Peace Corps volunteers serving abroad, which is something that should have been addressed in this reauthorization. I support the Peace Corps program, but could not support this bill’s final passage in its current form. I look forward to the Senate modifying these concerns to improve the legislation and is works its way through the legislative process. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 290-125.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.3157, the Bridging the Gap for New Americans Act. This bill will mandate a study on barriers to employment for naturalized U.S. citizens and non-Americans who are all legally in the country and have work authorizations. It is important that those who are here legally and can work are able to support themselves and contribute to our society instead of relying on federal assistance. This bill passed the House by a vote of 363-52.</span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 3895, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2022. This bill reauthorizes the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom through FY24. Freedom of religion is a cherished right and this important commission works to promote this right globally. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 402-4.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>September 15, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 2988, the more accurately named Limitless Whistleblower Protection Act. It is essential we protect good-faith whistleblowers who report abuses and waste in the federal government. However, this legislation will only empower bad actors to abuse the system by shielding employees from accountability or scrutiny of their claims. It will do this by shielding federal bureaucrats even if they are defying the lawful direction of the President and elected officials. This change will undermine oversight of the federal bureaucracy and our ability to ensure our government is meeting the needs of the American people. We must protect our self-governance and the rule of the people. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 221-203.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 8326, the Unaccountable Census Bureau Act. Our last census was a complete fiasco with multiple leadership and administrative challenges. However, the Democrats’ response with this legislation is to make Census Bureau leadership less accountable. This bill will prevent the President from easily replacing the Census Director and make the Census Director solely responsible for the operational, statistical, or technical decisions about the decennial census. Finally, it will limit the ability of the census to ask new questions, such as the commonsense citizenship question.  This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-208.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 302, the more accurately named Protecting Unelected Bureaucrats Act. Throughout the Trump Administration, many bureaucrats refused to do their duties to hamstring the will of the people and the policy priorities of the administration. In response, President Trump created a new “Schedule F” to hold some senior unelected bureaucrats accountable more easily. This bill however will ban the creation of a new “Schedule F” and make it even harder to remove non-performing or insubordinate federal personnel whose salaries are paid by the taxpayer. It is an extreme undermining of our ability to hold unelected policymakers accountable to the will of the American people. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 223-211.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>September 14, 2022</strong><span><span><br />
I voted "No" on H.R. 884, the National Aviation Preparedness Act of 2022, as amended. This bill would require a federal national aviation preparedness plan for disease outbreaks. While I support efforts to maintain public health, this bill does not include critical guardrails to ensure that Americans’ civil liberties are maintained. I am concerned that this could be used to impose overreaching mandates in the future on all travelers or airport staff. Additionally, this could lead to permanent and onerous new requirements being imposed on every traveler, such as future mask mandates or testing requirements. This bill passed the House by a vote of 293-133.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5774, the Expediting Disaster Recovery Act. This bill would require the FEMA administrator to allocate ten percent of certain disaster relief funds within 30 days of a disaster declaration. Additionally, this bill would give FEMA more flexibility in how disaster relief funds are spent to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster relief funds. This bill passed the House by a vote of 406-20.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 2293, the CREW Act. This commonsense bill will expand employment protections to FEMA reservists who have to temporarily leave work to deploy during a disaster and emergency declarations. The extension of these USERRA employment protections will make it easier for these employees to take leave and to be rehired after their service. Considering these reservists are putting their lives on hold to help their fellow countrymen, we have a duty to ensure they can easily return to their lives. This bill passed the House by a vote of 387-38.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 442, the Bright Act. As the guardians of taxpayers’ money, it is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure these funds are spent responsibly and effectively. This bill will make commonsense savings by requiring the General Services Administration (GSA) to use the most energy-efficient and cost-effective lighting systems in all federal buildings to the best extent possible. The bill passed the House by a vote of 347-78.</span></span><br /><br /><strong>September 13, 2022</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 4785, a bill to extend by 19 days the authorization for the special assessment for the Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund. This bill extends the ability of federal courts to collect $5,000 from individuals convicted of human trafficking to help fund the Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund. I believe it is reprehensible that Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the White House, allowed this critical program to expire on September 11, 2022. Without these funds, victims of human trafficking may not be able to access the resources they desperately need. Democrats should have brought up this reauthorization before the current authorization expired. This bill passed the House by a vote of 415-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 5315, the Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, as amended. While I fully support investing in the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), this bill is focused on promoting the left’s equity agenda and Green New Deal. Instead of simply focusing on investing in UAS to save lives and use tax dollars more efficiently, the Democrats included unnecessary provisions to further their radical agenda. As such, this bill does not fully benefit our local Upstate New York communities and I was compelled to vote against this measure. This bill passed the House by a vote of 308-110.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 1066, the Wildfire Recovery Act. The wildfires ravaging the country over the past few years have underlined the need for active forest management. Good land management practices like forest thinning make fires less frequent and less severe. This bill however increases the federal cost share for firefighting activities while refusing to sufficiently encourage local governments to enact much-needed best practices. This bill passed the House by a vote of 328-88. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>August 12, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 5376, the falsely named Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Over the past 18 months, Americans have been hit with decades high inflation and energy prices fueled by Democrats' reckless fiscal policy and war on domestic energy production. However, Democrats have not learned their lesson and are once again proposing to solve a problem caused by out-of-control government spending, with even greater out-of-control spending. This bill will raise taxes on American energy production by $12 billion. It also expands expensive federal subsidies for wind and solar, which have devastated affordable base-load power sources like nuclear and made our power grid less reliable and more expensive. As Americans are already struggling to make ends meet, this misguided bill will raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 by $16 billion, breaking yet another one of Biden’s promises. With small businesses pinching every penny just to keep their doors open, this bill will raise taxes by billions of dollars on nearly five million of America’s small businesses. And at a time when Americans are rightly worried about the weaponization of the federal government against a former President, this bill will hire 87,000 new IRS agents to target 710,000 Americans making less than $75,000 per year. Finally, this legislation offsets this big government Green New Deal spending through a $200 billion cut in Medicare spending, taking health resources away from our seniors and disabled. Any real solution to inflation should be focused on fiscal restraint and boosting domestic energy production, not splurging on leftist pet projects. This legislation is not ‘progress.’ It is an economic disaster in the making. This bill passed the House by a vote of 220-207.<br /><br /><strong>July 29, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act. Over the years</span></span></span><span><span><span>,</span></span></span><span><span><span> there have been tragic stories of captive big cats, such as lions and tigers, </span></span></span><span><span><span>being abused or </span></span></span><span><span><span>attacking and killing untrained owners and unwitting bystanders. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Big</span></span></span><span><span><span> cats should be owned and cared for by institutions</span></span></span><span><span><span> and individuals</span></span></span><span><span><span>that</span></span></span><span><span><span> are adequately equipped to care for them</span></span></span><span><span><span>. This </span></span></span><span><span><span>bill </span></span></span><span><span><span>makes sure that’s the case by expanding commonsense rules and regulations covering big cats. Importantly, the bill maintains exceptions for private entities, including organizations that seek and obtain a Class C Exhibitors License. Exceptions also exist for colleges and universities, veterinarians, and wildlife sanctuaries, among other specified entities. </span></span></span><span><span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 278-134.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act. This partisan bill funnels $4 billion in taxpayer funds to be used for unnecessary research and environmental studies, while failing to actually provide communities with water and other resources they desperately need. It undermines relief and preparedness efforts by including costly mandates that will lead to firefighters being laid off. The true intentions of the bill are revealed by the new regulations it includes related to “environmental justice communities,” which allows activists to block major energy and infrastructure projects. Instead of considering Republican proposals to develop and include important initiatives needed to create areas that are actually resilient, Democrats have used this bill to advance a radical climate agenda and needlessly expand bureaucratic red tape. This bill lacks a plan of action that has any capacity to combat the forest mismanagement and water storage issues immediately threatening our communities. Democrats are once again taking advantage of a crisis to advance partisan objectives. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 218-199.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022. This bill is yet another partisan attack on the Constitutional rights of Americans by those on the left who simply despise the Second Amendment. The bill will ban any additional sales of new “assault weapons” to civilians and requires a full background check for almost all ownership transfers of an “assault weapon,” even if it is to a spouse or other family member. Over 25 million Americans own rifles, which would be classified as “assault weapons” under this expansive, overreaching, and unconstitutional legislation. Even with their common usage, rifles are still the least likely firearm to be used in criminal activity, accounting for less than 3% of all homicides. This bill also goes far beyond a so called “assault weapons ban” and would make illegal numerous shotguns used by hunters and sportsmen. This legislation is not based on the Constitution, public safety, or the facts. For example, the DOJ found that the previous assault weapons ban had no impact on crime rates and that criminals did not need gun features like pistol grips or barrel shrouds to commit crimes. It is time we focus on real policies that will help make our communities safe and reduce crime, instead of recycling disproven talking points from the left. This bill passed by a vote of 217-213.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7283, the STREAM Act. This bill would make the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program funds authorized under the IIJA consistent with the existing federal program by allowing 30 percent of funds to be set aside for long-term costs for acid mine drainage treatment. Acid mine drainage can seriously threaten public health and ensuring that states have sufficient funds to address acid mine drainage is critical. This bill would not allocate any additional funds, but would reroute existing funds. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 391-9.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 3451, a bill to include certain computer-related projects in the Federal permitting program under title XLI of the FAST Act, and for other purposes. This bill would allow infrastructure projects involving semiconductors and other key technologies to be eligible for the FAST-41 expedited federal permitting program. This bill will help keep these important industries in the United States and encourage greater investments domestically. Additionally, this legislation will help counter China’s growing influence in the semiconductor and technology sphere by increasing U.S. leadership in the industry. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 303-89.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>July 28, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on the Senate Amendment to the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 4346, the CHIPS and Science Act. American industry has been hollowed out by decades of flawed policymaking and government inaction. Upstate New York has lost thousands of well-paying jobs to other states and competitors across the globe like China. That’s why I support policies to restore our industrial strength. I introduced the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act to provide capital to small manufacturing businesses, and I sponsored the Make It in America to Sell It in America Act to support the integrity of our supply chains for critical goods. Unfortunately, the CHIPS and Science Act lacks critical guardrails and includes loopholes that in the long run could benefit China. We should have done more to ensure tens of billions of dollars bolster American industry and not Chinese industry. Senators Rubio, Cotton, and Portman all submitted amendments to fix potentially disastrous issues, but they were voted down. In the House, there was no opportunity for amendments at all. Implementing safeguards would have prevented recipients of federal funding from continuing to expand operations abroad, including in places like China. They also would have protected America’s research and intellectual property. Much of the supported research under this bill will be executed in partnership with universities, which we know are notoriously vulnerable to Chinese espionage. On top of these shortcomings, Senate Democrats also announced, only hours after the bill passed the Senate, that they had struck an agreement on a partisan reconciliation bill. While they call it the ‘Inflation Reduction Act,’ the opposite is true. The bill is poised to send our country into a crushing recession even faster, and it is inextricably linked to passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. This partisan stunt by Democrats once again underscores their fundamental inability to understand basic economics. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 243-187, with one member voting present.<br /><br /><strong>July 27, 2022</strong><span></span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 3771, the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 2022.This bill establishes a new Centers for Disease Control (CDC) grant program for state awareness and educational initiatives regarding the prevalence of heart disease for at-risk populations, specifically the South Asian population. These grant programs, however, are entirely duplicative of existing CDC programs under the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. These programs already received over $1 billion in FY22, including programs specifically designed for outreach to higher-risk communities, such as the South Asian community. Further, all 50 states and local health departments have CDC-supported heart health initiatives to promote awareness of heart disease. Additionally, heart disease is the leading cause of death in America, making it a far-reaching problem. There is no reason why additional funds should be targeted to specific communities exclusively, rather than to the benefit of all Americans. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 237-192.</span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4040, the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2021. This bill will codify critical telehealth policies implemented during the pandemic while also making it easier for seniors – especially those in rural areas – to access emerging health care technologies. Telehealth has allowed patients to maintain access to their physicians, and early evidence has shown reasonable utilization and costs. This bipartisan legislation will build on the coverage gains made during COVID-19 by removing outdated statutory obstacles to care, especially for seniors and those in rural areas. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 416-12.</span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6929, the Susan Muffley Act of 2022. This legislation corrects an egregious wrong the Obama Administration performed in 2009 against the employees of the Delphi Corporation, a defunct former subsidiary of General Motors. After the company surrendered its pension obligations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as part of its 2009 bankruptcy agreement, the Obama Administration worked behind closed doors with union leaders to unfairly slash the pension benefits promised to Delphi’s 20,000 non-unionized salaried staff. This discriminatory and unfair agreement required these non-unionized employees to pay the entire cost of the pension’s minor funding shortfall, leaving many of them with a fraction of the benefits they were promised and paid into. Restoring the employees’ full benefits will directly help the 2300 affected Delphi employees across Western and Central New York, returning resources back to our communities. This bill passed the House by a vote of 254-175.</span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7981, H.R. 7733, H.R. 623, H.R. 3962, H.R. 4551, H.R. 5313, H.R. 7624, H.R. 7132, H.R. 7361, H.R. 3952, H.R. 6933, and H.R. 7569. This bloc of bills would reauthorize the Kids First Pediatric Research Program, create safety standards for the packaging of products that contain button cell batteries to protect children from accidentally ingesting them, and upgrade the National Weather Service personnel communication system, which shares critical weather warnings to the media, government offices, and emergency responders, among others.</span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>July 26, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 8454, the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act. This bill would expand medical marijuana and cannabidiol research, while simultaneously reworking the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval process for of marijuana and cannabidiol derived drugs. Before we start changing the process for FDA approval of any drugs, it is critical that we conduct further medical research first so we can make informed reforms based on science. This legislation very much puts the cart before the horse. We should continue conducting research prior to overhauling the approval process. This bill passed the House by a vote of 325-95.<br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 3588, the Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act. It is important for us to research, develop, and implement innovative approaches for teaching high-quality mathematics and statistics in public schools. While I support strengthening STEM education in our schools, this bill restricts private schools from accessing these important grants. This bill misses the mark and does not benefit all of our students. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 323-92.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 7180, the Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act. Congress has allocated more than $4 trillion on COVID-related aid, a portion of which remains unspent. Before spending additional funds for research and other purposes, Congress should have a firm understanding of what funding remains unspent and could be reprogrammed for other purposes, including important health and medical research projects. As inflation soars and hurts American families, Congress has a duty and obligation to make sure we use tax dollars responsibly. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 350-69.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6552, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022. This legislation reauthorizes and expands programs passed under the Trafficking Victims Prevention Act to combat human trafficking and modern slavery, domestically and abroad. It is tragic that fellow human beings are being bought and sold around the world. Congress must ensure that we are delivering the necessary resources to end human trafficking and assist trafficking victims. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I was pleased to support this legislation when it passed through committee, and I am pleased to support it again on the House floor. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 401-20.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7289, the Federal PFAS Research Evaluation Act. <span>Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of man-made chemicals that can often last for decades. Some of these substances can accumulate in the body over time and cause adverse health effects, such as thyroid disorders and cancer. Before being phased out, these chemicals were formerly used in firefighting foam and some water-repellents and are often found contaminating the areas around airports, industrial sites, and military bases like the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome. </span>This bill would require the National Academies of Science to study PFAS exposure and toxicity and develop a plan to address PFAS exposure. Bipartisan pieces of legislation to address PFAS, such as this bill, are critical to addressing existing PFAS exposure and learning more about the devastating effects of PFAS exposure. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 359-62.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7734, the Timely Delivery of Bank Secrecy Act Reports Act. Over the years, we have seen many high-profile leaks demonstrating how criminals have been using our banking sector to facilitate their illegal activities. Currently, banks are required to submit reports to the federal government when they see suspicious activities. However, the Treasury Department has unfathomably limited congressional access to these reports. There is a concern that the Department of the Treasury may be doing this as a preemptive move to limit Republicans from launching investigations into the dealings of Hunter Biden. If true, that would be unacceptable and underscores the need for this access to be codified. This bill passed the House by a vote of 349-70.<br /><br /><strong>July 21, 2022</strong><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 8373, the so-called Right to Contraception Act.<span> </span><span>Once again, this bill did not proceed through regular House order. It received no consideration whatsoever in the committee of jurisdiction - no hearing, no markup, no debate. Even worse, it is another attempt by Democrats to fear-monger and distract from the fact that despite being in charge, their radical agenda has divided America, driven up inflation, and deteriorated our country’s security and economic outlook. Not a single state in the country bans contraceptives. The fact is that in the United States, the right to contraceptives exists and is protected by virtue of existing Supreme Court jurisprudence. Further, it is not in jeopardy or under threat. Moreover, in the Dobbs decision, which overruled Roe v. Wade by holding there is no constitutional right to abortion, the Court distinguished its reasoning in that case from being applied to other constitutional matters, including the right to contraception. While I fully support a woman’s ability to access safe and legal contraceptives, this bill is designed to mislead Americans and score cheap political points. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 228-195, with 2 members voting present.</span></span><span></span><br /><br /><strong>July 20, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 8294, the Partisan Appropriations Package, which included funding for Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration; Energy and Water Development; Financial Services and General Government; Interior and Environment; and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Even with 40-year high inflation, House Democrats are still refusing to take this economic crisis seriously. Energy and living costs have reached record highs, and Speaker Pelosi and President Joe Biden’s policies are the driving cause. Instead of addressing these real problems, House Democrats instead forced a vote on an appropriations package that does nothing to deliver immediate relief to Americans. These partisan bills dramatically increase topline spending by 14%, include controversial new Democrat initiatives, strip out critical provisions prohibiting taxpayer-funded abortions, and incentivize further illegal immigration. It’s out-of-touch and grossly irresponsible. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-207.<br /><br /><strong>July 19, 2022</strong><br />
I voted "No" on H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act. I support the precedent established by the Supreme Court in <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> and believe, like the majority in Dobbs recently upheld, that the issue of marriage is fundamentally different than that of abortion. Today, same-sex couples are guaranteed the right to marry, and I agree with the established jurisprudence that this right should be protected. Despite this fact, House Democrats today tried to score cheap political points. They chose to forego regular order and the established rules of the House to advance the false narrative that the right of same-sex couples to marry is now under threat and that immediate legislative action by Congress is needed to safeguard it. This is simply not true. Democrats deliberately rushed this bill through Congress without any committee hearings, markups, or input from relevant stakeholders to avoid having a real debate. Had we followed the rules and debated this bill openly in committee, Republicans would have made clear that same-sex marriage is already protected in America and not under threat, making this bill completely unnecessary. We would have made clear to the American people that the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence has determined and upheld the right to same-sex marriage. As the majority in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson</em> recently stated, ‘…nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,’ including the right to same-sex marriage. And, finally, we would have made it very clear that the fear mongering by House Democrats is nothing more than a shamefully partisan stunt designed to distract the American people from the serious crises our nation faces today under their leadership, like rising crime, soaring inflation, and a wide-open Southern Border. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 267-157.<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 144, the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center Access Improvement Act. This bill would authorize the Indian Health Service (HIS) to construct a paved road to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center in California. The facility provides needed treatment for American Indian and Alaskan Native children aged 12 to 17 suffering from substance abuse and is currently only accessible by a dilapidated dirt road. This reasonable and narrow legislation will ensure these children in need receive the care they need. This bill passed the House by a vote of 379-41.</span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4404, the Kissimmee River Wild and Scenic River Act. This bill would direct the Department of Interior to study restored portions of the Kissimmee River to potentially add to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, which consists of rivers designated by the federal government for preservation. Within three years, the Department would submit its findings to the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. After the destruction of wildlife habitats in the 1940s, the Army Corps of Engineers restoration project already has contributed to the return of many wildlife species. This legislation will help ensure the conservation of the restored portions of the Kissimmee River for future generations. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 377-45.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7025, the Advancing Human Rights-Centered International Conservation Act of 2022. This bill would prohibit targeted international environmental conservation grants from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from going to organizations that have committed human rights violations. This bill will help ensure that U.S. funding does not support organizations that commit or coverup egregious human rights abuses against local populations. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 379-43.</span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7693, the National Park Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2022. This bill would reauthorize the National Park Foundation through fiscal year 2030. This legislation will reduce deferred maintenance at our national parks, advance public-private partnerships, and address pressing issues like park overcrowding by incentivizing innovative private-sector solutions. The National Park Foundation is an important nonprofit organization which works to create public-private partnerships and raise private funds to support the National Park Service. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 397-22.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>July 18, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1130, Expressing support for the sovereign decision of Finland and Sweden to apply to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as calling on all members of NATO to ratify the protocols of accession swiftly. Russia’s violent and unprovoked war against Ukraine has led Finland and Sweden to end their decades-long policy of non-alignment and act on their desire to join NATO. Finland and Sweden’s membership would help strengthen and modernize NATO, and as members, they would be required to spend at least </span></span><span>two<span> percent of their GDP on defense spending. It is in America’s national security interests for Europe to be as strong and defensively capable as possible to assure the stability of </span>the region and to lessen the financial burden on the United States<span>.</span> I believe firmly that Europe should be in the driver’s seat when it comes to sustaining and safeguarding its own security, which means countries in the region should take the necessary actions to increase their defense spending and not simply rely on others. <span> Finland and Sweden are both security-minded players that </span>are making a commitment to do just that. They <span>possess robust military capabilities and experience working with the US and NATO</span>. Their<span> entry into the Alliance will significantly strengthen regional security in the face of Vladimir Putin’s senseless aggression. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 394-18.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>July 15, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access for Abortions Act. This reactionary bill </span></span></span><span><span>is yet another proposal from Washington Democrats to codify and advance portions of their radical abortion-on-demand agenda, which is simply out of touch with where a majority of Americans are on this deeply moral issue. <span>This legislation does nothing to prevent an unrelated adult or sexual abuser from taking a minor out-of-state for an abortion. It also undermines mandatory reporting laws in states that require health professionals, social workers, and schools to report instances of child abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect that could be seen as delaying or hindering access to an abortion</span>. It also <span>undermines the ability of states to hold sexual abusers accountable. Finally, this bill would stop states from preventing abortion pill mills and gives human traffickers and abusers more direct access to chemical abortions to hide evidence of their </span>heinous <span>crimes. We need to protect the rights of victims and minors, not the rights of criminals who continue to abuse our most vulnerable. I will continue to support compassionate pro-life policies that ensure women and families, especially those facing unexpected pregnancies, have the tools, resources, and support they need to make decisions that embrace life. This bill passed the House by a vote of 223-205. </span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 8296, the more accurately named Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act. This legislation once again proves how radical House Democrats have </span></span></span><span><span>become<span> in their pro-abortion advocacy. Long gone are the days in which they advocated for “safe, legal, and rare.” Instead, House Democrats are once again bringing up this piece of legislation that goes far beyond codifying <em>Roe</em> and places virtually no restrictions on abortion, putting the United States on par with China and North Korea in allowing the most radical abortion policies in the world</span>, including sex-selective abortion<span>. While Democrats claim that this bill will “codify <em>Roe</em>;” it is far more extreme and would create a national standard allowing for abortions for any reason and at any stage up until birth. This bill allows for discriminatory abortions based on a baby’s sex, race, or disability and overrides state laws that would protect unborn babies with Down </span>s<span>yndrome and other disabilities. This legislation would also weaken conscience protections for medical providers who refuse to provide abortions and removes commonsense protections to ensure parental involvement for minors or laws protecting women from coercion. Overall, this radical bill is out of step with the 80% of Americans who support restrictions on abortion, especially in the third trimester. The right to abortion is not one that has ever been guaranteed or protected by the Constitution of the United States. The right to life is one of the most fundamental principles underlying our Constitutional framework. I will always stand for the unborn and oppose the dangerous abortion-on-demand policies that are being pushed by far-left politicians in New York and Washington. This bill passed the House by a vote of 219-210.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 8351, the Formula Act.</span></span></span> <span><span><span>This bill will help families though our nation’s current baby formula shortage</span></span></span><span><span> by <span>temporarily suspending all tariffs on imports of baby formula until December 31, 2022. The Formula Act will ensure families have access to plentiful and affordable infant formula. The Biden Administration, which </span>knew<span> about the looming shortage since last year, has been far too slow in dealing with this crisis </span>, yet another entirely <span>of its own creation. This bill will ensure families are not paying additional taxes on formula imported into the United States to cover for shortages that President Biden should have averted months ago. This legislation will ensure these families can access affordable and safe formula while we reboot our domestic formula supply chain following the Biden Administration’s shutdown of much of our domestic production capacity. While I would have welcomed more fundamental and wide ranging reforms to boost domestic production and ensure we never repeat this tragic situation, this emergency demands immediate and effective relief for affected families</span>, which this bill delivers<span>. This bill passed the House by a vote of 421-2.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>July 14, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 203, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4020 Broadway Street in Houston, Texas, as the ‘‘Benny C. Martinez Post Office Building.” Benny C. Martinez has my enduring gratitude for his service in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. After his service, he was a Latino civil rights activist. As a council member of his local League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) chapter, Mr. Martinez was a partisan activist who worked to elect local Democrats. Additionally, LULAC advocates for numerous partisan policies, such as universal healthcare, taxpayer-funded abortion, and expansive benefits for illegal immigrants. While I deeply appreciate Mr. Martinez’s service to our country and commitment to his community, I continue to firmly believe that Congress should not use the Post Office naming process to advance partisan causes or activists – it should be a unifying process designed to honor individuals who made extraordinary contributions to their communities beyond partisan activities and policies. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 386-35, with 4 members voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 5659, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1961 North C Street in Oxnard, California, as the ‘‘John R. Hatcher III Post Office Building.” John R. Hatcher III served in the U.S. Air Force and was later a civil rights activist who served as a chapter and regional president in the NAACP. Throughout his career, Mr. Hatcher stated that he believes our country's institutions, specifically law enforcement and the criminal justice system, are systemically racist. While I deeply appreciate Mr. Thatcher’s service to our country and commitment to his community, I continue to firmly believe that Congress should not use the Post Office naming process to advance partisan causes or activists – it should be a unifying process designed to honor individuals who made extraordinary contributions to their communities beyond partisan activities and policies. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 348-63, with 5 members voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7900, FY23 National Defense Authorization Act. This important legislation provides our military and its leaders with the resources it needs to defend the nation, supports servicemembers, and counter our adversaries. Specifically, the bill reverses President Biden’s dangerous cuts to our military by boosting the defense topline by $37 billion, ensuring growth of 7% in FY23. This 7% growth will help our nation meet the levels called for by President Trump to rebuild the military and strengthen our defenses. The bill increases support for our servicemembers by providing a 4.6% pay raise and extending the prohibition on dishonorably discharging servicemembers who refuse a COVID-19 vaccination. This year’s NDAA invests in the modernization of our nuclear arsenal, increases vital resources to counter China, and strengthens oversight of all Department of Defends funds, including those provided to Ukraine. It also includes important provisions that will help ensure the security and stability of Israel, our democratic ally in the Middle East, in the face of malign Iranian aggression. This year’s NDAA also takes proper action to declare the record number of illegal immigration crossings that are occurring at our Southern Border. As a risk to our national security, the bill rightfully funds the National Guard’s operation and maintenance account to support proper border deployment and efforts to counter human trafficking and the infiltration of illegal narcotics. House Republicans fought hard to ensure that this legislation pushes back on the left’s woke agenda by clarifying that lethality is the centerpiece of our national defense strategy and any activities that do not increase lethality are a distraction from the Department of Defense’s mission. I am especially pleased that the bill passed tonight contains four amendments that I drafted, including one to ensure our military has the technology to counter Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems that are used to target Americans and exploit air space, and two measures to counter Iran’s malign influence. Another will stop American infrastructure projects from going to companies affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party or those headquartered in China, ensuring federal contracts do not subsidize the CCP’s gross human rights abuses. The NDAA will help safeguard the United States, counter threats, and support our service men and women. While I did not agree with every provision in this bill, its passage prioritizes policies to strengthen our defenses, improve readiness, and advance research and development that will give our military forces critical advantages. I am pleased that Republicans were able to push back on demands from far-left Democrats, who ultimately voted against the bill, and ensure that our national security is strengthened. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 329-101.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span>I voted “Yes” H.R. 1934, the Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G Act.</span><em> </em><span>This bill directs the President to establish an interagency working group to provide assistance and technical expertise to enhance U.S. leadership in international bodies that set standards for 5th and future generations of mobile telecommunications (5G) technology, such as the International Telecommunication Union.

I voted “Yes” on H.Con.Res 59, Condemning the October 25, 2021, military coup in Sudan and standing with the people of Sudan. This concurrent resolution condemns the October 25, 2021, coup in Sudan. It recognizes the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the constitutional leaders of Sudan's transitional government and calls for Sudan's military junta, among other things, to immediately release all civilian government officials, civil society members, and other individuals detained in connection with the coup; return to constitutional rule under the transitional constitution; and lift the state of emergency, including complete restoration of all means of communication. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417-7.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.Res. 720, Calling for stability and the cessation of violence and condemning ISIS-affiliated terrorist activity in northern Mozambique, including the Cabo Delgado Province. This resolution condemns the terrorist attacks and violence carried out by ISIS-Mozambique in the Cabo Delgado Province and urges the government of Mozambique to take actions to counter violent extremism and protect its citizens. We must condemn the violent extremism and terrorism that ISIS-affiliated groups continue to spread in all countries, including Mozambique.

I voted “Yes” on H.Con.Res. 45, Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the execution-style murders of United States citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in the Republic of Serbia in July 1999. This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that the individuals responsible for the July 1999 murders of U.S. citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in Serbia should be brought to justice and that the United States should devote sufficient resources to fully assist and monitor Serbia's efforts to investigate and prosecute such individuals.

It also urges the U.S. government in all interactions with the government of Rwanda to raise the case of Paul Rusesabagina and to press for his immediate release on humanitarian grounds. Finally, the resolution expresses support to the family of Paul Rusesabagina and their commitment to bringing him home. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 413-8.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7337, the Access to Veterans Records Act of 2022. It is important for those who served our country to receive help and benefits quickly and efficiently. However, throughout the pandemic, the backlog of requests for records at the National Personnel Records Center has exploded to over 600,000. This system houses records that are essential for veterans to receive service-related benefits, including medical treatment, unemployment assistance, and emergency housing services. The primary drivers of these outrageous delays were the lack of digitization and on-site workforce during the pandemic. This bill will as a direct response to this issue, provide $60 million to address the backlog, enhance cybersecurity, and digitize the records. It also requires the center to submit a plan to Congress regarding how they will eliminate the backlog with target timeframes.

This legislation reauthorizes the Department of Homeland Security’s National Computer Forensic Institute (NCFI) until 2032. Over the next decade, the mission of the NCFI will be to equip and educate state and local law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, and members of the U.S. Secret Service’s cyber fraud task forces on how to investigate and identify emerging threats to United States cybersecurity. As the global threat landscape continues to evolve, is critical that we ensure our cybercrime investigations and cyber incident response are as effective as possible. </span></span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 410-16.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5274, the Prevent Exposure to Narcotics and Toxics (PREVENT) Act of 2021. This legislation amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide USCBP agents with training on the use of containment devices to prevent secondary exposure to fentanyl and other hazardous and potentially lethal substances. As narcotics and related contraband continue to stream over our unchecked Southern Border, Congress must ensure that members of law enforcement are well equipped to safely handle substances like fentanyl, which can be fatal in even the smallest of doses. </span></span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 429-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022. This previously failed suspension bill is an unnecessary and redundant piece of legislation that adds another layer of bureaucracy to the highly politicized Biden Department of Justice (DOJ). This bill establishes a National Coordinator at DOJ to issue best practices and guidelines for states and local governments’ active shooter emergency alert systems. This bill uses federal coordination, coupled with broad definitions of “active shooter” and “populated area,” to encourage state and local governments to issue emergency alerts in a manner designed to stoke public fear of firearms. Furthermore, states already use a federal system to issue emergency alert notifications, including for active shooter emergencies. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) is a federal system that allows public safety agencies to send wireless emergency alerts to mobile devices and emergency alerts to media platforms and internet service providers. Instead of providing real solutions to this spike in crime, House Democrats have brought multiple anti-gun bills forward, which will do nothing to make our communities safer. This bill is no exception. DOJ can already issue best practices and guidance related to public safety alerts, and there is no suggestion that states and localities currently have difficulty in managing emergency alerts or would benefit from a federal coordinator. </span></span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 260-169.<br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “No” on the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act.</span><strong> </strong><span><span>I strongly support efforts to deliver much-needed relief to veterans suffering from exposure to dangerous toxins. </span></span><span>During my time in Congress, I have helped to pass bills to improve veterans access to care and benefits, including the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act, the Enhancing Veteran Care Act, and more<span>. Congress has been working for years to craft targeted legislation to provide much needed and deserved care and benefits to veterans suffering as a result of toxic exposure to toxins. </span>Unfortunately, this legislation, as considered by the House of Representatives, used an accounting trick to shift the spending from discretionary to mandatory, which could open the door to even further reckless spending by President Biden, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader Schumer despite inflation recently hitting a 41-year-high of 9.1%. I appreciate Ranking Member Bost’s work to improve this legislation and supported his amendment to this bill, which would have ensured toxic-exposed veterans received the care they need, while also removing this budget gimmick. I am very disappointed that this amendment failed, and that Congressional Democrats sabotaged this important legislation. Had this change been made, I would have been honored to support the final bill. However, I will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve upon this concern and ensure that we keep our commitment to veterans and deliver the care, resources, and support they need and deserve. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 342-88.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>July 12, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.Res. 1168, a resolution that reaffirms the economic partnership between the United States and the Caribbean nations. It is important for the United States to work with our Caribbean neighbors to ensure they are prosperous, stable, and protect the rights of their citizens. However, this bill goes far beyond this scope and expresses the need for us to force liberal policy priorities on these nations, such as the left’s equity agenda. The provisions in this bill completely miss the mark and do not fully benefit our partners in the region. This bill passed the House by a vote of 351-64.</span></p><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 521, the First Responder Fair RETIRE Act.</span><strong> </strong><span>This bill would ensure that federal firefighters, law enforcement officers, Border Patrol officers, and other federal first responders receive full retirement benefits if they are injured while on the job by allowing them to remain in the first responders’ retirement program so long as they continue working in a different civil service position. This legislation is critical to protecting retirement benefits for Federal first responders who become disabled in the line of duty, and I wholeheartedly support efforts to stand for those who have put their physical safety on the line for the American people. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417-0.</span></p></div><div><div><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 5271, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2245 Rosa L Parks Boulevard in Nashville, Tennessee, as the ‘‘Thelma Harper Post Office Building.” Thelma Harper served as a Tennessee State Senator for over 30 years, during which time she opposed an important legislative provision to prevent taxpayer funded abortions. While Ms. Harper was a dutiful public servant, I believe that we should not name Post Office facilities after partisan politicians, rather this honor should be reserved for those who made extraordinary contributions to their communities. </span><span><span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 330-81, with 3 members voting present. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>June 24, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on S. 2938, the Senate Gun Control Bill. The compromise struck by the Senate pushes overreaching, unconstitutional, and failed gun control measures that will do little to make our communities safer at great expense to the Second Amendment rights of Americans. This legislation expands support for red flag laws at the federal level, potentially allowing the government to confiscate the guns of Americans without sufficient due process protections. It also requires young Americans to wait significantly longer to legally purchase a firearm, effectively creating a second class of citizens who can vote and join the military but face new restrictions when legally purchasing a firearm. This overreaching gun control legislation will not stop the violent shootings taking place across our country or address the unprecedented spike in violent crime our communities are facing. However, it will restrict and undermine the freedoms of law-abiding Americans, while handing more power to the federal government and unelected bureaucrats. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 234-193.<br /><br /><strong>June 23, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on the House Amendment to S. 2089, the Keep Kids Fed Act. </span></span><span><span>This bill provides funding and flexibility for communities to provide children with healthy meals throughout this summer and provides support to schools and daycares to respond to supply chain challenges and high food costs caused by soaring inflation. This legislation also directs the Secretary of Agriculture to help schools and families return to paid meal programs, and allows no-cost, nationwide waivers to help schools maintain paid meal program operations. Importantly, this bill does not incur any new costs since all of the spending is offset by rescinding funding from prior COVID-19 related legislation. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 376-42.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5407, the Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Through Campus Planning Act. </span></span><span><span>This bill requires the Department of Education to work alongside the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage colleges and universities to address the nationwide mental health crisis among students by creating proactive plans for preventing suicide and promoting mental health</span></span><span> resources<span>. These comprehensive plans must comply with strategies recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Suicide Prevention Resource Center, specifically its nine-part Comprehensive Approach to Suicide Prevention. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth between the ages of 15 and 24. </span>G<span>iven that the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns have exacerbated the mental health crisis facing our Nation,</span> especially among children,<span> it is more important than ever to ensure students have proper support systems and services in place. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 405-16.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6493, the Campus Prevention and Recovery Services for Students Act.<strong> </strong>This bill requires higher education institutions that receive federal funding to adopt and implement an evidence-based program to prevent alcohol and substance misuse by students and employees. The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services then will identify and promote programs successful </span>to<span> achieving this goal as well as issue a report to Congress on efforts and best practices from institutions. The bill also reauthorizes an existing federal grant to support evidence-based alcohol and substance misuse prevention programs and authorizes funding at $15 million per year for the next five years. College students routinely make up a significant portion of the population that abuse drugs and alcohol on a regular basis, necessitating </span>targeted and evidence-based<span> program</span>ming to provide resources, support, and assistance<span>. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 371-49.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 4176, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act. At a time of record high inflation and supply line dysfunction, we need to be pushing policies that improve </span></span><span>our<span> prosperity and opportunity, not divide Americans </span>further<span> based on their identity. </span>This<span> legislation</span> pushes the left’s woke agenda rather than delivering solutions for the American people. It<span> requires federal agencies to include sexual orientation and gender identity related questions on the more than 130 currently administered federal surveys, including the census. This data collection bill is another attempt to force Americans to provide personal information to the federal government as a means to classify and categorize the American people. House Republicans offered commonsense amendments, such as including a question of citizenship on the census, all of which were rejected by House Democrats. Currently the federal government already collects </span>data similar to this<span>, but only when it is applicable to the policy at hand. </span>Aside from the woke nature of this bill and the mandated inclusion of extraneous information on all future federally administered surveys, c<span>onsidering the federal government’s history of large data leaks, the additional collection of this personal </span>information could also further<span> undermine the privacy of Americans. This misguided bill is another attempt by House Democrats to push their social agenda while ignoring immediate crises like inflation, gas prices, the open border, the baby formula shortage, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, or oversight of funds provided to Ukraine. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-201.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>June 22, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7666, the </span><span>Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act.<strong></strong>This legislation contains many bipartisan bills and reauthorizations of grants that seek to address mental health problems, substance abuse disorders, and suicide prevention, especially amongst children and young adults.  It also reauthorizes critical public health programs to address the nation’s mental health needs, prevent suicide, and support substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. In addition, the bill prohibits the Biden Administration from using funds from the bill to purchase or distribute crack pipes. </span><span>This legislation also includes a bipartisan bill I introduced and contains many conservative wins as well. It is the first major effort to date to address the mental health crisis caused by government driven lockdowns and school closures during the pandemic. It also supports mothers at every stage of life by providing care for maternal health and substance use disorders, which are among the leading causes of death for pregnant and postpartum women. The provisions of this bill are targeted, fiscally responsible, and ensure accountability across federal agencies. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 402-20.</span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5585, the Advanced Research Project Agency - Health Act. This legislation authorizes funding to ARPA-H while placing guardrails on the agency to require transparency and ensure that it stays focused on biomedical research and breakthrough technologies in health and medicine. This legislation authorizes the establishment of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Health (ARPA-H), a new agency within HHS to accelerate innovation in health and medicine by investing in high-risk, high-reward research projects. It also places several additional constraints on the agency, including the prohibition of awarding any grants to malign foreign countries. </span>By authorizing ARPA-H, this bill reigns in wasteful spending, requires agency accountability and transparency, and prohibits federal funding to China and other adversarial nations. House Republicans fought for provisions in this bill to keep the Biden Administration from using excess appropriations for superfluous initiatives. In doing so, we can make sure that funding is directed to biomedical projects and not the Democrats’ political agenda. <span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 336-85.</span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act of 2022.

I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7777, the Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training Act. This legislation amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish an Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Training Initiative within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  This initiative aims to provide cost-free cybersecurity workforce training concerning the security of industrial control systems. These systems are responsible for critical industrial processes, ranging from manufacturing to production and distribution. As advanced technologies continue to develop and become an integral part of the industrial process, it is essential that our cybersecurity professionals are well-equipped to respond to emerging threats to our nation. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 368-47.<br /><br /><strong>June 16, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 7606, the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act. In another effort to shift inflationary and supply chain blame from the Biden Administration to businesses, H.R. 7606 would create a duplicative, unfunded office within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) headed by a “special investigator” with a mandate to investigate meat packers and live poultry dealers. The investigator would be granted “independent litigation authority,” providing carte blanche power to file civil suits against packers at the whims of the Secretary without any coordination with the Department of Justice (DOJ)—a longstanding practice required under current law. This legislation also waives requirements to allow E-15 gasoline and higher biofuels blends to be blended and sold commercially year-round and authorizes $400 million in grants for building, installing, or upgrading biofuels infrastructure. Because these provisions were not considered by the Energy and Commerce Committee during a hearing or markup, it is unclear whether they would in fact meaningfully reduce gasoline prices without placing unnecessary regulatory burdens on retailers or increasing emissions. This bill misses the mark once again, and will do little to nothing to fix the hard-hitting issues that Americans are currently facing. House Democrats and the Biden Administration have pursued a reckless spending and regulatory agenda that compounds the situation and further limits American farmers’ ability to meet global food demand. In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world must increase global food production — not divert potential food and feed to be used for biofuels, which will have no positive effect on gas prices. Unfortunately, this package is House Democrats' latest attempt to scapegoat private industry rather than addressing the very real needs and concerns of family farms and rural America. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 221-204.<br /><br /><strong>June 15, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 2543, the Financial Services Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act<strong>.</strong> This legislation wrongly expands the Federal Reserve’s mandate to include addressing socio-economic disparities rather than its intended focus on sustainable employment and price stability. This new responsibility falls outside the core competency of the Federal Reserve and will only distract officials at a time when they should be solely focused on reducing inflation. This reckless bill would pile regulatory costs on small businesses already struggling with labor shortages and increased costs by imposing a one-size-fits-all mandate to report diversity and inclusion data. Finally, at a time when potential home buyers face rising mortgage rates, the bill increases regulatory and compliance requirements on loan providers that will only be passed on to home applicants. This is nothing more than the politicization of the Federal Reserve. While American families are on the brink of financial crisis, paying exorbitant costs for goods and services in their daily lives, House Democrats continue to drive their reckless woke agenda. If they took this plight seriously, they would advance bipartisan legislation to lower costs, reduce regulatory burdens, and unleash American energy. Instead, House Democrats have chosen to mandate that the Federal Reserve, the primary federal agency responsible for combatting inflation, shift its focus to advance a woke social agenda. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 215-207.<br /><br /><strong>June 14, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 2773, the misguided Recovering America’s Wildlife Act of 2021. While protecting out wildlife and ecosystem for recreation and sportsmen should be a bipartisan principal, House Democrats denied all good faith Republican outreach to improve this legislation. They also added partisan provisions to the legislation after it was reviewed in the committee process, bypassing the critical input of Members. T</span><span>his legislation has no federal spending offset, resulting in $1.4 billion in additional deficit spending every year, with a mandatory cost of $12.7 billion in the first ten years alone. Second, it does not include any changes to the Endangered Species Act that would encourage parties to come to the table instead of allowing extreme environmentalists to tie up projects in the court system. Third, in a circumvention of the legislative process, committee Democrats air-dropped a new provision in the bill that will effectively siphon money away from the states and toward the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), contrary to the original intent of the bill. Finally, this bill has no sunset, denying Congress a mechanism to revisit this legislation and update it appropriately so it meets evolving needs. At a time of Democrat-caused reckless spending, now is not the time to pile on more debt that will drive inflation higher and saddle current and future generations with the consequences. While RAWA provides funding towards endangered species conservation, it ignores the reality that the Endangered Species Act needs common-sense reforms to promote species recovery and provide more certainty when it comes to meeting the needs of people as well as fish and wildlife. </span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 231-190.</span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 4160, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act. This bill will expand protection by the Supreme Court Police to the families of Supreme Court justices. Following the unethical leaking of a draft decision in the <em>Dobbs v. Jackson </em>Supreme Court case, the justices have been bombarded with threats and protests at their homes, culminating in the attempted murder of one justice last week. Congress must take necessary action to protect the justices and their families and to guard the Court from intimidation or political pressure. This long overdue bill, which Speaker Pelosi refused for weeks to bring up for consideration, passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 396-27.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on the House Amendment to S. 516, the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act. This bill creates a working group comprised of members from multiple government agencies to engage and work with the civil aviation industry. It will work to set up safety and operation standards for new vertical lift aircraft and drone technologies. After having heard from multiple companies in Rome, NY regarding the lack of regulatory framework for Unmanned Aerial Standards (UAS), this legislation will help finally create standards for our local companies to work within. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 380-30.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7211, the Small State and Rural Rescue Act. Many small and rural communities often face barriers in fairly accessing federal aid after flooding and other natural disasters. This bill will expand and codify the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Small State and Rural Advocate when helping state and local officials demonstrate localized impact and apply for aid. It will also instruct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review how FEMA mobilizes individual aid after a disaster. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 396-14.</span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>June 13, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 3580, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. As ports across the country become congested with imported goods </span></span><span>as a result of Biden’s supply chain crisis<span>, agriculture exports have been hit hard with increased costs and transportation challenges. This has impacted many of our </span>upstate New York <span>farmers</span>, <span>who are </span>now <span>finding it </span>more difficult than ever<span> to access markets</span> abroad<span>. This legislation will prohibit ocean carriers from unreasonably denying U.S. exports</span>,<span> as </span>monitored and <span>determined by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). It will also require ocean carriers to report to the FMC how many empty containers they are transporting back to foreign ports. All told, this </span>bill should<span> help American farmers and reduce our $106 billion per month trade deficit</span> by ensuring empty cargo containers leaving U.S. ports are filled with U.S. goods that benefit our small businesses and family farms<span>. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 369-42.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6270, the Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization (AAIM) Act. This legislation creates a $12.5 million a year grant program to help state and local governments plan for the eventual integration of advanced air mobility technologies, including new vertical lift aircraft and drones. These </span></span><span>technologies have<span> the potential </span>to change<span> the way people and goods move within and between urban, suburban, and rural areas. This planning will ease the rollout of drones and will benefit the Syracuse-Rome corridor, which is at the forefront of drone testing. The AAIM Act will ensure America remains a leader in aviation innovation. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 338-73.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2020, the Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act.<strong></strong><span>This legislation requires every government agency to create a central repository of requirements needed for their disaster relief funding. It also requires the agencies to centrally list a detailed description of all the disaster funding they provided in the previous quarter. This will bring greater transparency and accountability to our disaster relief programs and make it easier for smaller communities to apply for</span> and secure needed emergency<span> funding. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 412-2.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>June 9, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 2377, the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act. This partisan bill is an undeniable infringement on our due process and Second Amendment rights. It would authorize federal courts to issue <em>ex parte </em>orders requiring law enforcement to seize ammunition and firearms from individuals without proper notice or the opportunity to be heard. This legislation also establishes a grant program to bribe states into issuing such orders with concerningly low evidentiary standards and due process protections. Many of the most dangerous cities across our country already have red flag laws in place and have seen no discernible decrease in gun violence or homicides. A 2018 study by the Crime Prevention Research Center found that “red flag laws had no significant effect on murder, suicide, the number of people killed in mass public shootings, robbery, aggravated assault, or burglary.” Unfortunately, rather than working with Republicans to find commonsense solutions to address rising crime rates and harden our school security, House Democrats chose to advance poorly crafted legislation focused on firearm confiscation and which further undermines the Constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. Infringing further on the Constitutional rights and due process of Americans is not the answer, and it will not solve the problem. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 224-202.<br /><br /><strong>June 8, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on the unconstitutional H.R. 7910,</span></span><span> the so-called<span> Protecting Our Kids Act. </span>The recent shootings in Buffalo, Uvalde, and Tulsa are senseless acts of pure evil. Our nation grieves for those lives lost. As a mother, I can only imagine the pain and frustration families are experiencing as they cope with the loss of a son, daughter, mother, father, brother, or sister. In the face of these tragedies, the question is not whether we should respond, but rather how we can respond effectively and responsibly to address rising crime in our communities. Unfortunately, House Democrats once again missed the mark. <span>This partisan bill undermines the Second Amendment rights of </span>law-abiding <span>Americans and fails to make the changes required to keep our communities safe</span> and fight the tide of rising crime across America<span>. First, this legislation prohibits 18 to 20-year-olds from purchasing almost all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, a restriction already found illegal by a recent ruling in federal court. This restriction would, in practice, create an underclass of American citizens who can vote and die for our country but</span> who<span> cannot defend themselves in their own home</span> as they see fit<span>. Second, it creates a top-down firearms storage requirement </span>that<span> would undermine the owner’s right to immediately defend themselves under <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>. Third, it bans any magazine of ammunition feeding device </span>that<span> can hold more than 15 rounds, even though the courts have found that magazines greater than 10 rounds are protected under the Second Amendment. </span>The bill would also make it a crime to lend someone a firearm for the purpose of self-protection, including in the case of domestic violence or for training purposes. <span>This legislation is</span> sadly <span>nothing more than a far-left anti-Second Amendment wish list that </span>completely fails<span> to take concrete steps to improve our nation’s mental health system or harden our schools</span>, two issues which many Americans support further action to address<span>. </span>As crime grips our nation, America<span> deserves better than this partisan </span>bill that undermines the Constitution and violates the due process of American citizens<span>. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 223-204.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7352, the PPP and Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act of 2022. Throughout the pandemic, Congress spent an unprecedented $5.3 trillion dollars on COVID-19 relief programs. Some of these funds went to programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which allowed many businesses to stay afloat </span></span><span>during<span> the pandemic and continue paying their employees. However, there have been multiple instances of fraud </span>in many of these programs, yet<span> federal law enforcement </span>agencies do<span> not have the time or resources to review </span>increasing <span>fraud claims. This bill would amend the Small Business Act to extend the statute of limitation for fraud by borrowers under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to ten years. This higher limit would be </span>consistent with the limitations applied to<span> bank fraud. The current statute of limitations for all SBA programs is </span>six<span> years. The higher limit will give federal authorities more time to </span>identify<span> fraud and claw back fraudulent funds</span> on behalf of the American taxpayers<span>. This bill passed the House <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>of Representatives </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>by a vote of 421-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7334, the COVID-EIDL Fraud Statute of Limitations Act of 2022. Throughout the pandemic, Congress spent an unprecedented $5.3 trillion dollars on COVID-19 relief programs. Some of these funds went to programs like the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (COVID-EIDL) program</span></span><span>, <span>which allowed many businesses to stay afloat through the pandemic and continue paying their employees. However, there have been multiple instances of fraud </span>in many of these programs, yet<span> federal law enforcement </span>agencies do<span> not have the time or resources to review </span>increasing <span>fraud claims. This bill would amend the Small Business Act to extend the statute of limitation for fraud by borrowers under the COVID-EIDL program to ten years. This higher limit would be in line with </span>existing limitations for <span>bank fraud. The current statute of limitations for all SBA programs is </span>six<span> years. The higher limit will give federal authorities more time to find fraud and claw back fraudulent funds. This bill passed the House <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>of Representatives </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>by a vote of 416-3.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5879, the HubZone Price Evaluation Preference Clarification Act of 2021. It is important for the federal government to cultivate a competitive marketplace of government contractors to ensure accountability and the best long-term value for taxpayers. However, occasionally smaller contractors are unable to provide the absolutely lowest price against larger competitors. This risks shrinking the pool of government contractors and raising the cost to taxpayers in the long run by limiting choices and reducing competition. As a solution, the HubZone program allows qualified firms to compete against larger companies with a 10% price preference. The legislation would extend this price preference to a larger variety of federal contract types, ensuring a larger and more diverse pool of federal contractors and small businesses can compete for federal contracts while maintaining taxpayer protections and cost accountability measures. This bill passed the House <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>of Representatives </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>by a vote of 359-61.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7622, the Small Business Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022. This legislation amends the Small Business Act to include requirements relating to apprenticeship program assistance for small business development centers (SBDC’s). These amendments allow SBDCs to share information from the Department of Labor and related federal agencies regarding the creation and improvement of work-based learning opportunities, as well as apprenticeship and job-training programs. Highly skilled, well-supported employees are essential to the success of any small business, which is why I am a </span></span><span>strong<span> supporter of this bill. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 368-52.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7664, the Supporting Small Business and Career and Technical Education Act of 2022. This legislation amends the Small Business Act to require that small businesses and women business centers receive assistance in hiring graduates from career and technical education programs. Graduates of these programs are well-equipped with the skills required to help our nation’s small businesses thrive. Hiring assistance </span></span><span>benefits<span> employers and employees alike, bolstering our local economies while simultaneously providing vocational opportunities for program graduates. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 399-18.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7670, the Women-Owned Small Business Program Transparency Act. I introduced this legislation alongside Rep. Houlahan (PA), which establishes reporting requirements for the Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program, furthering transparency and accountability, while also ensuring that Congress receives the necessary data to closely monitor </span></span><span>this program<span>. It would require the Small Business Administration (SBA) </span>to <span>provide information as to the amount of contracting dollars awarded through the program, the number of certifications being issued, the amount of program examinations being conducted, the number of companies being decertified, the number of contracts incorrectly awarded, and any actions taken by SBA to </span>more effectively<span> train agency personnel. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 402-19.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7694, the Strengthening Subcontracting for Small Businesses Act of 2022. This legislation amends the Small Business act to extend the requirement that compliance with prior subcontracting plans be considered as part of evaluating past performance for new contract awards. Current law requires that large contractors must have subcontracting plans and shall be assessed on their ability to meet the goals established by them. However, there is no present requirement that previous compliance be considered during the contracting process. Increased transparency and accountability in the federal contracting process will not only expand opportunities for small business to take part in federal contract work, but also make sure that larger contractors utilize small business as part of their required subcontracting plans. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 411-11.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7776, the Water Resources Development Act of 2022. This bill would provide for improvements to the rivers and harbors of the United States, to ensure the conservation and development of water and other related resources. It will help improve ports and harbors, inland waterway navigation, flood and storm protection, and other water resources infrastructure throughout the United States. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 384-37.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7667, Food and Drug Amendments Act of 2022. This bill would reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) user fees program through fiscal year 2027. The FDA’s user fees program allows the organization to collect user fees from the makers of brand and generic prescription drugs, biosimilars, and medical devices in exchange for commitments to review applications expeditiously. This bill will also include policy changes to improve critical supply chains, promote innovation, and lower the costs of prescription drugs through competition. With Americans paying more than ever for prescription drugs and supply chain disruptions making it harder to get prescriptions, it is critical that we take steps to drive down prices for American consumers, ensure access to needed drugs, and bring more lifesaving drugs to market. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 392-28.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>June 7, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to Workers’ Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act. This bill would allow nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) to diagnose, prescribe, treat, and certify an injury and extent of disability for purposes of compensating federal workers under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act. Not only does this expand the scope of practice at the federal level, but it takes a critical function away from physicians who have proper education, expertise, and experience. This legislation could threaten the health and safety of patients and increase health care costs while diminishing the responsibilities and oversight of physicians. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 325-83.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 3823, the Bankruptcy Threshold Adjustment and Technical Corrections Act. <span>This legislation will raise the debt limit back to $7.5 million for small businesses electing to file for bankruptcy under subchapter V of Chapter 11. It also raises the debt limit for individual Chapter 13 filings to $2.75 million and removes the distinction between secured and unsecured debt for that calculation. This bill will provide greater access for struggling small businesses and families to achieve a fresh financial start for a more stable future. Our nation’s small businesses are the backbone of this country, and we should seek to improve their stability and chances of success. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 392-21.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>May 19, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 7688, the so-called Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act. This bill would give President Biden the unprecedented and unilateral power to declare an energy emergency, arming bureaucrats at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with tools to impose de-facto, arbitrary caps on the price of gas. This bill is a federal attack on the energy sector and will not address our current energy crisis, which is a direct result of the Biden Administration’s war on domestic energy. This bill will lead to even less oil and gas production at a time when we desperately need to increase both. Like the crisis experienced in the 1970s, costly and overreaching government price fixing will lead to shortages and massive lines at the pump. This bill is a blatant attempt by the Democrats to distract and shift blame from the Biden Administration’s energy and inflation crisis and blame energy producers, while providing absolutely no evidence of price gouging. It also ignores that fact that many states, including New York, already have laws against price gouging and would be able to act against any unfair pricing practice if it was occurring. Even though these price spikes are largely based on a lack of supply, House Democrats have continued blocking attempts by Republicans to bring commonsense legislation to the floor that would significantly enhance the production of clean American energy. Americans are already suffering enough under the inflation, energy, and supply chain crises created by President Biden’s failed agenda and the incompetent individuals he has appointed have failed to meaningfully address them. They have created this problem and giving them more power to interfere in our economy and artificially fix prices will not solve the crisis, it will only make it worse. Now is the time to switch to a strategy we know will work: unleash domestic American energy production now to reverse the damage of the Biden Administration’s assault on our domestic oil and gas industry. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 217-207.<br /><br /><strong>May 18, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 6531, the Targeting Resources to Communities in Need Act of 2022<strong>. </strong>This bill will direct additional federal funding to high poverty areas throughout the country. While it may be well-intentioned, this bill is overly broad and fails to fairly consider areas of high poverty across the country, including in rural areas like those across upstate New York. For example, none of the communities in New York’s 22<sup>nd</sup> district would fit under the definition of communities in need as outlined in the legislation. The broad authority of this bill in the hands of the Biden Administration – or any Administration for that matter – also means that Executive Branch agencies could utilize taxpayer dollars in inappropriate ways and without adequate oversight and direction from Congress. I voted against this bill when it previously failed to pass the House by a suspension of the rules and because it remains unchanged, voted against it again. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 258—165.</span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on S. 2938, a bill to designate the United States Courthouse and Federal Building located at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee, Florida, as the ‘Joseph Woodrow Hatchet United States Courthouse and Federal Building.’ As a member of the 11<sup>th</sup> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Hatchet wrote the majority opinion overturning the right of students at the Duval County School System to select, by majority vote, a message or prayer to be read during their graduation ceremony. This overreaching decision violated the right of freedom of religion and had a chilling effect on American civic life. It is important as a country that we resist radical attempts to demonize faith and our nation’s strong and proud heritage of religious expression. I voted against this bill when it previously failed to pass the House by a suspension of the rules. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 230-190, with one member voting present.</span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H. Res. 1125, Condemning Antisemitism. This resolution calls on elected officials, faith leaders, and civil society leaders to condemn anti-Semitism in all its forms. It also calls for renewed efforts to combat anti-Semitism domestically, globally, and online. We must unequivocally denounce and condemn hate, violence and harassment targeting the Jewish people. Congress must continue to stand together and work tirelessly to identify, call out and eradicate anti-Semitism in any form. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 420-1.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5738, the Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms Act. This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to guarantee that each VA medical center has a location, separate from a restroom, for mothers to breastfeed their children. This location must be private, handicap accessible, clearly identifiable, and easy to locate. Similar spaces are already available for women who work in VA medical facilities, and this legislation expands upon available breastfeeding spaces to include women Veterans and visitors. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 420-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7335, the MST Claims Coordination Act. This legislation requires that the VA provide additional resources to individuals immediately following situations involving military sexual trauma (MST). These additional resources include outreach letters, information on the Veterans Crisis Line, information on how to make an appointment with a mental health provider, in addition to any additional resources such as peer support specialists that may be relevant. I will always support our nation’s Veterans and their access to critical mental health services, especially following such traumatic events. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6064, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to seek to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for a review of examinations, furnished by the Secretary, to individuals who submit claims to the Secretary for compensation under chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code, for mental and physical conditions linked to military sexual trauma (MST). This legislation requires the VA and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to collaborate in conducting a review of VA medical examinations for those submitting service-connected MST disability claims. This review shall also include an examination of MST related physical and mental examinations to assess the connection between MST and any identifiable impairments. This legislation ensures a comprehensive review of the VA’s claims process to identify and correct potential shortfalls. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 414-2.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2724, the VA Peer Support Enhancement of MST Survivors Act. This legislation requires the VA to provide a peer support specialist for each individual filing an MST claim unless the individual declines. Peer support specialists must be trained as victim advocates and are not involved in adjudicating a service member’s claim. This legislation guarantees that sexual assault survivors in the military have access to vital peer support networks that the VA has not yet developed. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 420-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 4089, the Veterans Rapid Restraining Assistance Program Restoration and Recovery Act. This legislation restores benefits for Veterans whose education was halted as a result of school closures and loss of eligibility under the Veteran Rapid Restraining Assistance Program (VRRAP) and authorizes the VA to recoup federal dollars from fraudulent schools. This program served as a critical source of job training and economic support, yet countless Veterans were defrauded by ill-intentioned schools looking to make a profit. This legislation rights this egregious wrong and restores benefits for affected Veterans. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 401-17.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 2533, the Making Advances in Mammography and Medical Options for Veterans Act. This legislation requires the VA to submit a plan for improving Veteran breast imaging services. Under this bill, the VA must implement a tele-screening mammography program for those lacking access to VA facilities, upgrade facility mammography services, update policies to improve service, and ensure accessibility of breast imaging sites when transferring veterans to non-VA providers. The VA must also partner with centers for the National Cancer Institute across each Veterans Integrated Service Network to expand and increase the quality of women veteran cancer care, including tele-health options for rural areas. An estimated 1 in 8 women across the United States will develop breast cancer over the course of this lifetime, presenting an urgent need to update existing VA infrastructure to account for the needs of women veterans everywhere. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 419-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 2102, the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act. This legislation expands eligibility for VA mammography screenings for veterans who served in various locations and combat zones, across specified time periods, that may have placed them at an elevated risk of exposure to toxic substances. As service-related illnesses involving toxic exposure continue to emerge, it is essential that Congress expand eligibility for life-saving screening services. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 418-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6052, the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General Training Act of 2021. This bill </span><span>would direct the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide trainings to its employees developed by the VA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) on topics such as how to report wrongdoing or respond to requests from the OIG. This bill would recognize the opportunities for employees to engage with OIG staff to improve the VA’s programs, operations, and services. In doing so, it also protects employees from unwarranted retaliation. This bill would also help the VA to identify circumstances and mechanisms for better reporting fraud, waste, abuse. </span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 407-11.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6943, the Public Safety Officer Support Act. </span><span>This bill would expand the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits (PSOB) program to include coverage for public safety officers who die because of suicide or are disabled because of job-related trauma. Currently, the PSOB provides disability relief to families of officers who died or who have been permanently disabled as a result of a physical injury. The work of public safety officers – firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical technicians – places them at an increased risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The bill creates an avenue for officers to seek disability benefits for PTSD linked to severe job-related trauma and allows the families of officers who are lost to trauma-linked suicide to apply for death benefits. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 402-17.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2992, the TBI and PTSD Law Enforcement Training Act.</span><span> This bill would provide better training to law enforcement for interactions with individuals suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Developing and implementing training programs that provide information on recognizing the signs and symptoms of TBI and PTSD can help improve emergency response, public and first responder safety, and interactions between first responders and individuals with these conditions. Further, by better understanding the prevalence of TBI and PTSD among our nations' law enforcement officers and first responders, we can take an essential steps to promote officer health and wellness. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 400-21.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R.7791, the Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022. Across the country countless families have had trouble finding baby formula, making them spend countless hours searching stores for this necessity. This formula shortage is even worse for families who rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. Current WIC guidelines limit the types of baby formula that recipients can buy for their infants. This bipartisan bill will allow the Secretary to temporarily waive these limits to allow WIC beneficiaries to have greater choice during periods of supply disruption. It is a reasonable solution to provide immediate relief to families in need. This bill passed the House by a vote of 414-9.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 350, the partisan Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022. All persons performing acts of terrorism must be brought to justice under the full force of the law. That is why the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Federal Bureau of Investigation all have multiple agencies, offices, and initiatives to prevent, investigate, and prosecute acts of domestic terrorism. This current legislation was originally drafted by House Democrats to target Americans who lawfully advocated against excessively restrictive COVID-19 mandates and parents who attended their local school board meetings. Now, Democrats are using a tragic situation to revive this deeply flawed bill. Like the Biden Administration’s proposed “Ministry of Truth,” this bill needlessly injects partisanship into the non-partisan work of the Homeland Security Department, which should not be motivated by politics in carrying out its vital law enforcement and investigative functions. The bill creates new, duplicative, and costly processes and could also negatively impact American civil liberties. It also focuses on a narrow definition of domestic terrorism that deliberately omits far-left extremist movements like Antifa. This bill passed the House by a vote of 231-192.</span></span></span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 7790</span></span></span><span>, the</span><span> Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act. This bill gives $28 million to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the ongoing baby formula shortage, without providing any meaningful guidance or requiring the Biden Administration to take meaningful actions to ensure this never occurs again. But the fact of the matter is that the FDA and Department of Agriculture already have millions of dollars available to address supply chain issues. That’s why this bill is a too-little-too-late feel-good measure designed to create the illusion of action without providing any immediate relief. Rather than this political theater, Congress should be taking real action to force President Biden to immediately lift key regulatory barriers that are limiting production and remove restrictions that are preventing well-regulated formulas from being imported. These steps will provide immediate relief and address critical supply issues. Ultimately, this bill as drafted and considered will not put more formula on store shelves, nor will it hold the FDA accountable for their mishandling of this issue. However, it will needlessly waste more of your money without proper guidance or oversight – it is the worst impulse of Washington to think they can throw money at a problem, without actually providing meaningful solutions to address it. We need real, sensible solutions that reinforce our domestic baby formula production so American families can always have access to this staple. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 222-203.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>May 17, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 7309, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Many businesses across the country are suffering from worker shortages and are unable to find employees with the proper skillsets and training. The solution </span><span>should be to work with companies and employers to boost workforce development training options and opportunities for Americans. Unfortunately, this bill includes many far-left provisions that completely detach workforce training from the actual needs of employers, diluting employer voices and needs in our nation’s workplace training policies and programs. In addition, it bans workforce boards from partnering with employer-based apprenticeships and mandates the use of union-preferred registered apprenticeships, needlessly reducing options for students. It also bans any for-profit institutions from participating in federal workforce training programs, excluding many existing training facilities with strong track records of success. Finally, it allows training programs to bypass the needs of employers in determining their training standards, undermining the entire system. These irresponsible changes will damage our nation’s workforce training programs and fail to provide the necessary reforms needed to unleash opportunities for America’s workers and job creators alike. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-196.</span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 2520, the State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act of 2021. This bill would encourage federal cybersecurity experts to share information surrounding cyberthreats, vulnerabilities, and breaches with state and local government officials, as well as share resources to prevent and recover from cyber attacks. State and local governments increasingly find themselves the targets of cyberattacks, resulting in millions in taxpayers dollars lost and private data for millions of Americans compromised. This legislation would help local governments provide critical services to residents in the event of such attacks. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 404-14.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6873, the Bombing Prevention Act of 2022. This bill formally establishes the Office of Bombing Prevention in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and creates additional measures to enhance our government’s ability to detect, protect against, and respond to explosive terrorist attacks. This would help protect our critical infrastructure, houses of worship, and schools from bomb threats and attacks. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 388-26.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6871, the DHS Acquisition Reform Act. This bill tasks the DHS undersecretary for management with new responsibilities including leading the Department's acquisition oversight body, the DHS Acquisition Review Board, in addition to evaluating the risks of failure to achieve costs and advising the secretary on all acquisition management activities. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 398-15.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6868, the Cybersecurity Grants for Schools Act of 2022. This bill authorizes the Director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to award grants to states, local governments, and education institutions for cybersecurity curriculum and educational tools. The idea is to incorporate cybersecurity into K-12 education to train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. By incorporating cybersecurity into our school's curriculum, we <span>will be able to bring up the next generation with a strong foundation in the cybersecurity workforce. </span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 383-30.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 3527, to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to transfer the name of property of the Department of Veterans Affairs designated by law to other property of the Department. This bill updates the requirements for transferring the name of a property from one Department of VA property to another. This allows the Department to transfer naming of properties more efficiently and effectively. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 412-2.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 1760, to designate the community-based outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs planned to be built in Oahu, Hawaii, as the “Daniel Kahikina Akaka Department of Veterans Affairs Community-Based Outpatient Clinic”. Senator Akaka was the first native Hawaiian to serve in the Senate. He strongly supported many vital defense programs and was active in bringing attention to drug addiction and supporting harsher sentences for drug dealers. After retiring from the Senate in 2013, he passed away in 2018. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 384-22, with 4 members voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 2514, to rename the Provo Veterans Center in Orem, Utah, as the “Col. Gail S. Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans Center.” Col. Halverson was born in Utah, where he joined the Civil Air Patrol prior to enlisting in the Air Force in 1942. Assigned to Germany in 1948, Halverson was selected as one of the pilots to participate in the Berlin Airlift, during which he gained the nickname “Candy Bomber” for dropping candy to German Children during the operation. He was also the founder of “Operation Little Vittles” where he dropped candy using miniature parachutes to the people of Berlin, for which he received a Congressional Gold Medal. Col. Halverson’s candy dropping efforts continued across the world for another 25 years. Colonel Halverson delivered compassion, kindness, and, yes, candy during some of the most tumultuous years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Following his passing this February at the age of 101, it is my privilege to honor Col. Halverson’s memory by supporting this legislation. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 410-1, with 2 members voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7500, the Fiscal Year 2022 Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Authorization Act. This legislation authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out specified major medical facility projects for FY22 and establishes a maximum amount that can be spent for each project. These projects include hospitals, community living and mental health centers, research facilities, spinal cord injury buildings, as well as various renovations and repairs for facilities across the nation. Included in this bill is up to $443,900,000 for the construction of a community living center and renovation of a domiciliary and outpatient facilities in Canandaigua, New York. Congress must do more to support our nation’s Veterans and guarantee access to the care they so desperately need. A brand new, state-of-the-art facility in Canandaigua will provide a much-needed update to New York’s veteran service network. This bill passed the House of Representative by a vote of 402-2.<br /><br />
I</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> voted “Yes” on H.R. 5754, the Patient Advocate Tracker Act. I am a cosponsor of this bill, which requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Patient Advocacy to establish an electronic system for veterans and patient advocates to file a complaint, as well as review its status once submitted. It is imperative that we increase transparency and accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially as countless veterans struggle daily to receive much needed care, or simply schedule an appointment. While there is still much more progress to be made, this legislation serves as a positive step in the right direction. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 411-1.<br /><br />
I</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> voted “Yes” on H.R. 6604, the Veterans Eligibility to Transfer School (VETS) Credit Act. This legislation streamlines the method by which college credits are transferred if a student Veteran’s school closes or their program abruptly ends. This bill requires that the VA work with students to explain the transfer process and provide necessary certificates of eligibility to show proof of restored benefits.  After bravely serving our country, Veterans are rightfully entitled to a full range of education benefits. In the event that an institution or program concludes unexpectedly, it is essential that we eliminate unnecessary confusion and ensure our Veterans retain their hard-earned course credits. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 412-1.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 2687, the Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act. This legislation grants the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA OIG) the power to subpoena witnesses until May 31, 2025. The VA OIG may not issue any subpoenas as part of a criminal proceeding and must notify the Department of Justice (DOJ) of the witnesses to be subpoenaed. Providing the VA OIG with subpoena authority will increase accountability and expand Congress and the VA’s ability for oversight and review of the health care system. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 404-6.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7375, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to update the payment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow for electronic fund transfer of educational assistance, administered by the Secretary, to a foreign institution of higher education. This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to update its payment system to allow for electronic fund transfer of VA educational assistance to a foreign institution of higher education that provides an approved course of education to eligible recipients and does not have an employer identification number or an account with a domestic bank. Student Veterans should have the opportunity to receive education abroad. <span>The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 397-15.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6376, the Student Veteran Work Study Modernization Act. This bill would allow part-time student Veterans to access the VA Work Study programs, ensuring they can complete their certification or degree without taking on unmanageable amounts of student debt and still care for themselves and their family. Currently, work-study programs are available through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for student Veterans enrolled in secondary education programs full-time, including vocational or professional programs. But many Veterans have difficulty enrolling full-time while balancing their work, family, and oftentimes a VA-related disability. This legislation would help ensure that our Veterans have the full range of work opportunities while furthering their education. <span>The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 370-43.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7153, the Department of Veterans Affairs Principles of Benefits Automation Act. This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a plan for the modernization of the information technology systems of the Veterans Benefits Administration over the next five fiscal years. This bill would help modernize the delivery of compensation benefits to disabled veterans and bring the Veterans Benefits Administration into the 21st century. <span>The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 410-3.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>May 16, 2022</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6824, the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition Act. This bill would financially reward the best and brightest federal employees and service members who prove their skills by successfully completing an array of cyber challenges. Since 2019, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has run the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition, an annual event which aims to identify, challenge, and reward the best cybersecurity talent in the federal workforce. The President’s Cup was created in response to Executive Order 13870: America’s Cybersecurity Workforce, but it had never become law. This legislation would codify the competition and ensure that CISA can provide a monetary award to the successful competitors. This bill passed the House by 386-61.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6825, the Nonprofit Security Grant Program Improvement Act of 2022. This bill would expand and strengthen the Nonprofit Security Grant Program that helps secure nonprofits and houses of worship against terrorism. In response to the growth in the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which was funded at $180 million last year, the bill directs FEMA to establish a dedicated office within FEMA to administer the program and provide greater outreach, engagement, education, technical assistance, and support to eligible nonprofits. This legislation would enhance security for houses of worship and protect Americans and our faith communities from terrorism and hate crimes. This bill passed the House by 288-129.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5658, the DHS Roles and Responsibilities in Cyber Space Act. Within a year of passage, this bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to submit a report to the House and Senate Homeland Security committees outlining its responses to various cybersecurity incidents. The report must also clarify the responsibilities of the Department in responding to those incidents. This legislation will help policymakers determine the current threat environment and improve it to meet future threats and cyber attacks. It is critical that the federal government has well-formulated and transparent roles and responsibilities for dealing with such attacks and that Congress understands these roles and has the ability to shape them. This bill passed the House by 313-105.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>May 13, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5129, the Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act. This legislation will reauthorize this critical program for another decade and make overdue updates and reforms to ensure all taxpayer funds are used appropriately and transparently. This long-term reauthorization will give state and local agencies the tools to lift families and individuals out of poverty in a cost-effective manner through commonsense policies and initiatives focused on workforce development, nutrition assistance, childcare services, and other evidence-based practices. The bill requires federal approval of state plans to ensure strong oversight as well as a timely flow of funds to state agencies. It will also mandate the use of performance metrics to strengthen evaluation and monitoring of all programs. The bill ensures faith-based organizations remain active and equal participants in all programming opportunities. The CSBG program supports more than 1,000 Community Action Agencies (CAAs) across the country, including many throughout New York’s 22nd Congressional District. These Communication Action Agencies, which I have visited countless times to ensure robust oversight and accountability, provide much-needed assistance to low-income communities and the most vulnerable Americans, especially young children. CSBG funds are vital to supporting these local programs and agencies. Supporting locally-driven solutions to issues of poverty through a program like this that has a demonstrated record of cost-effectiveness and accountability will help us meet the needs of our communities and assist more families and individuals in New York with services like workforce training, childcare and development, emergency housing assistance, and youth training initiatives. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 246--169. <br /><br /><strong>May 12, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 903, the Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of 2022. This bill would transfer employees of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) from their current TSA personnel system to the Title 5 personnel system. While there is a problem with poor pay among TSA frontline staff as well as high turnover, this legislation is an inadequate solution to the problem. A May 2019 Blue Ribbon Panel determined that low pay among frontline TSA workers is the primary driver of turnover. However, its recommendation was for targeted pay raises, rather than a shift to the GS Scale as this bill would require. The GS Scale is over 70 years old and has been criticized for discrimination against those who have much-needed skills but do not have advanced decrees. This legislation could have the opposite of the effect it intends by leading to lower-than-expected pay for good workers without a college or graduate degree like many of those employed by TSA. The other Title 5 provisions would also impact operational nimbleness and passenger safety by, among other things, allowing security procedures to be subject to collective bargaining. This means the TSA may not be able to quickly change security policies to adapt to new and emerging threats. It would also make it more difficult to dismiss problem employees who are not upholding their job duties or violating the personal privacy of passengers. The correct solution to salary problems and other issues at TSA would be to appropriate additional funds to the agency to pay frontline staff, while keeping the TSA’s need flexibility intact. This bill passed the House by a vote of 220—201.</span><br /><br /><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 91, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 810 South Pendleton Street in Easley, South Carolina, as the “Private First Class Barrett Lyle Austin Post Office Building.” Private Lyle courageously sacrificed his life in Afghanistan after his vehicle was attacked by an improvised explosive device. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 412—3, with 2 members voting present.<br /><br />
I</span></span></span><span> voted “Yes” on H.R. 92, to designate</span><strong></strong><span>the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 110 Johnson Street in Pickens, South Carolina, as the “Specialist Four Charles Johnson Post Office.” Specialist Four Charles Johnson was killed in action while bravely serving our country during the Vietnam War. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 405—3, with 2 members voting present.</span><br /><br /><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 207, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 215 1st Avenue in Amory, Mississippi, as the “Command Sergeant Major Lawrence E. ‘Rabbit’ Kennedy Post Office Building.” Lawrence Kennedy served in the U.S. Army for 35 years and fought in World War II, as well as the Korean and Vietnam wars. Kennedy bravely fought in the historic Battle of the Bulge and carried the American flag ashore in Vietnam while leading the Army’s 1st Cavalry 9th Division into combat. Kennedy earned numerous medals, including four Legions of Merit and four Bronze Stars. When he retired in 1975, he was one of the most decorated soldiers, if not the most, in the history of the U.S. Army. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 408—3, with 2 members voting present.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 209, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 305 Highway 15 North in Pontotoc, Mississippi, as the “Lance Corporal Marc Lucas Tucker Post Office Building.” Lance Corporal Tucker served in Iraq as a member of the United States Marine Corps where he was involved in a fatal motor vehicle accident. He served his country with honor and bravery. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 406—3, with 2 members voting present.<br /><br />
I</span></span></span><span> voted “Yes” on H.R. 3508, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 39 West Main Street, in Honeoye Falls, New York, as the “CW4 Christian J. Koch Memorial Post Office.” Koch was a member of the New York Army National Guard, where he passed away during a routine medical evacuation training when his helicopter crashed. Prior to his tragic passing, Koch served in Afghanistan in 2012 and 2013, and the war in Iraq in 2008 and 2008.  Following the attacks of September 11, 2001 Koch was a part of Operation Noble Eagle, the 2004 National Guard Security Mission in the United States. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 408—3, with 2 members voting present.</span><br /><br /><strong>May 11, 2022</strong><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 2499, the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act, which makes changes to federal workers’ compensation benefits for federal firefighters. <span>I will always support our nation’s first responders. In Congress, I support numerous bills to enhance benefits and protections for them and I will continue fighting to enact them in Washington. Unfortunately, this bill lacks the oversight and accountability necessary to be administered in a reasonable manner with integrity to truly prioritize those most in need and impacted by line of duty deaths, illnesses, and injuries. This bill fails to consider vital reforms already being made by the Department of Labor’s Office of Workers’ Compensation, nor does it incorporate information from the National Firefighter Cancer Registry, which is still being compiled. I supported a commonsense amendment to this bill that would have established a streamlined Firefighter Special Claims Unit to better address the occupational risks and concerns of federal firefighters and authorize a study into changes that may be needed, which House Democrats unfortunately rejected. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 288—131.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 847, the Promoting Digital Privacy Technologies Act. This bill directs the National Science Foundation to support competitively awarded, merit-reviewed research for privacy enhancing technologies to support our nation’s computer and network hardware and software. It is important that we continue to support critical computer and network technologies so that our nation can protect itself against emerging threats. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 401—19.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5324, the NWR Modernization Act. This bill provides for the upgrading and expansion of the Weather Radio All Hazards network as administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It authorizes improvements to support areas currently lacking adequate cellular service and ensures that all necessary equipment is repaired and maintained. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 397—20.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 66, the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act. This bill responds to the prevalence of harmful algae blooms in South Florida, which has created harmful hypoxic conditions. Specifically, this legislation establishes an Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia to identify and submit a plan for reducing the number of algal blooms in the South Florida ecosystem. This bill based the House of Representatives by a vote of 412—7.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7077, the Empowering the U.S. Fire Administration Act. This bill authorizes the United States Fire Administration (USFA) to conduct investigations for major fires and other unique disasters. These investigations should always proceed in coordination with relevant federal, state, and local entities to determine, among other things, a fire’s cause and origin. The USFA shall release a public report to federal, state, and local authorities regarding the results of future investigations. This bill will ensure that we have the proper tools and resources to conduct investigations and assessments for major fires. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 379—37.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1437, the Providing Research and Estimates of Changes in Precipitation (PRECIP) Act. This bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to update U.S. precipitation frequency estimates at least every five years and to ensure they are publicly available. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 333—81.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 1872, the United States Army Rangers Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act. This bipartisan bill would award a Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to the United States Army Rangers Veterans of World War II in recognition of their extraordinary service during the war. U.S. Army Rangers bravely wore the uniform of this great nation and participated in some of the most important battles of World War II. The impact and influence of these soldiers and the sacrifices they made to protect their fellow Americans cannot be overstated, and this bill would recognize the valor and extraordinary service of these courageous Army Rangers. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 418—0.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 5911, the Fair Hiring in Banking Act. This legislation creates exceptions to the restriction on hiring individuals who have been convicted of criminal offenses involving dishonesty and related breaches of trust from working at insured depository institutions like banks and credit unions. While I recognize the value of seeking gainful employment post incarceration and acknowledge that every circumstance is different, we must also take steps to ensure the safety, security, and integrity of the financial sector and those who work in it. This bill is overly broad and prescriptive, especially since individuals can already seek waivers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration if previously convicted, which allows for an appropriate case-by-case review of each individual request. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 329—88.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5914, the Empowering States to Protect Seniors from Bad Actors Act.<br />
This bill reauthorizes and revises the Senior Investor Protection Grant Program. The bill also creates a new Senior Investor Protection Grant Program to support state enforcement agencies and task forces charged with protecting and educating seniors on financial fraud. With this bill, agencies and task forces will be able to hire additional investigative staff, invest in proper equipment and training, and educate seniors on financial scams. Seniors are especially vulnerable to scams and fraud, and it is important that we take reasonable steps to protect them and invest in greater awareness and prevention. </span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 371—48.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 935, the Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act of 2021. This bill exempts from securities registration requirements certain merger-and-acquisition brokers that facilitate transfer of ownership in privately held companies with earnings or revenues under a specified threshold. This exemption does not apply to certain brokers, including those who provide financing related to the transfer of ownership, engage on behalf of any party in a transaction involving specified shell companies, or are subject to suspension or revocation of registration. </span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 419—0.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7066, the Russian and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act of 2022. This bill will clarify that foreign subsidiaries of U.S. financial institutions must comply with American sanctions against the Russia Federation and the Republic of Belarus. This bill represents a significant step forward in imposing sanctions on Russia and Belarus for their senseless invasion of Ukraine. Financial sanctions are a strong and effective tool that the United States can and must use to hold Russia and Belarus accountable for their unprovoked aggression. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 418—2.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7081, the Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act of 2022. This bill will direct the Treasury to use its influence at the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, other multilateral development banks, and with private creditors, to press for the suspension of all debt owed by Ukraine and for financial assistance to Ukraine and the countries along its borders taking in refugees. Ukraine has close to $2.7 billion in principal and interest payments due to the World Bank and IMF in 2022. The government of Ukraine should not be expected to repay its debt to the international financial institutions while it is mobilizing all its resources to fend off the Russian invasion and provide vital services to its citizens. This legislation is a small measure that we can take to provide immediate relief to Ukraine so that they can focus their attention and resources on defeating Russian aggression. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 362—56.</span></span><span><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span></span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6891, the Isolate Russian Government Officials Act of 2022.<strong></strong>This bill will exclude government officials of the Russian Federation from attendance at the following meetings: G-20, Bank for International Settlements, Basel Committee for Banking Standards, Financial Stability Board, International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and International Organization of Securities Commissions. The Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve would implement the exclusions and these exclusions would expire five years after enactment or 30 days after the President reports to Congress that the Government of the Russian Federation has ceased its destabilizing activities with respect to the sovereignty of Ukraine. This bill will further diminish Russia's influence worldwide and ensure greater isolation until Putin fully backs down from his unwarranted invasion. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 416—2.</span></span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6899, the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act of 2022.<strong></strong>This bipartisan bill will prohibit the Treasury Secretary from exchanging dollars for IMF Special Drawing Right (SDRs) assets held by Russia or Belarus, and would require the Secretary to push IMF member countries to deny these transactions as well. These SDRs total over $25 billion and represent unconditional liquidity for the Putin and Lukashenko regimes, which are working hand in hand to systematically dismantle a sovereign Ukraine. The more successful we are in cutting off Russia’s access to its reserve assets and export earnings, the more vital their SDRs become. We must therefore work with the IMF to make sure the SDR process is also blocked, and that such a freeze continues if Russia’s hostilities against Ukraine continue. SDRs are one of the last remaining sources of financing that are available for Moscow, and this bill would ensure they cannot access it. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417—2.</span></span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 6531, the Targeting Resources to Communities in Need Act of 2022<strong>. </strong>This bill will direct additional federal funding to high poverty areas throughout the country. While it may be well-intentioned, this bill is overly broad and fails to fairly consider areas of high poverty across the country, including rural areas like those across upstate New York. For example, none of the communities in New York’s 22<sup>nd</sup> district would fit under the definition as outlined in the legislation. The broad authority of this bill in the hands of the Biden Administration – or any Administration for that matter – also means that Executive Branch agencies could utilize taxpayer dollars in inappropriate ways and without adequate oversight and direction from Congress. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 262—156.</span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 224, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 5302 Galveston Road in Houston, Texas, as the “Vanessa Guillén Post Office Building.” Specialist Vanessa Guillen was reported missing from Fort Hood in April 2020 and was later found dismembered and burned nearby. Spc. Guillen was a dedicated service member who proudly served her country. This bill ensures that her legacy lives on and her memory is not forgotten. <span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 408—0, with one Member voting present.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 700, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 303 East Mississippi Avenue in Elwood, Illinois, as the “Lawrence M. ‘Larry’ Walsh Sr. Post Office”. Larry Walsh was first elected to public service at the age of 21 and served for almost 50 years. Walsh also served as a member of the Elwood School Board, as Jackson Township supervisor, twice as a Will County Board member and as an Illinois state senator for the 43rd District from 1997 until 2005. Walsh was a dedicated public servant and served his community with honor. <span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 380—26, with one Member voting present.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5900, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2016 East 1st Street in Los Angeles, California, as the “Marine Corps Reserve PVT Jacob Cruz Post Office.” In November 1943, Cruz was a member of Company D, 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force, which landed against stiff Japanese resistance on the small island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands, in an attempt to secure the island. Over several days of intense fighting at Tarawa, approximately 1,000 Marines and Sailors were killed and more than 2,000 were wounded, while the Japanese were virtually annihilated. Cruz died on the third day of battle, November 22, 1943. His remains were lost due to a bureaucratic error and recently discovered. Cruz served his country with great honor and was a dedicated Service member benefitting of this legislation. <span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 401—1, with one Member voting present.</span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6386, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 450 West Schaumburg Road in Schaumburg, Illinois, as the “Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial Post Office Building.” This bill names the post office after the dedicated Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, who served their country with honor and bravery. <span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 404—0, with one Member voting present.</span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>May 10, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7691, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act. I am deeply disappointed that Democrats did not release the full text of this bill further in advance. It is yet another example of their failed and chaotic leadership in Washington. While I am disappointed in the process leading up to this bill’s consideration, after reviewing this legislation and working on this important issue for several weeks, I believe this bill addresses urgent security concerns while eliminating unnecessary and wasteful provisions. This bill provides roughly $40 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine through military and security assistance, sanctions enforcement and asset seizures, and humanitarian and economic assistance. The bill makes certain that Ukraine continues to have the tools, resources, and support to fight back against Russia’s bloody and unprovoked war. As I mentioned, prior to the bill’s consideration, House Republicans fought hard to keep unnecessary and overreaching provisions out of the package, including $22.5 million in COVID funding, harmful immigration provisions, and $21 billion in loans to an unaccountable Chinese-supported trust fund at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We also fought successfully to ensure that pro-life provisions were protected in the final bill. The additional resources made available by this bill are urgently needed to provide military assistance to Ukrainian forces and support our own national defense by backfilling the Department of Defense (DOD) stocks of weapons and equipment. It also addresses the humanitarian crisis created by this conflict, including drastic food shortages. Moreover, this supplemental bill provides much-needed support for U.S. troops and domestic weapons production and includes strong oversight language to ensure proper use of funds. This bill ultimately sends a strong message to Vladimir Putin that the United States will continue to use every tool at our disposal to protect our interests and those of our allies and partners abroad. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 368—57.<br /><br /><strong>April 28, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on S.3522, Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. This legislation streamlines the authorities for the President to lend and lease defense equipment to Ukraine and other Eastern European countries impacted by Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. These efficiencies will enable our nation to better assist Ukraine and other nations bolster their defense capabilities and protect their civilian populations. I have continuously called for swift assistance to Ukraine to help the Government of Ukraine and its people fend off the brutal Russian invasion. By making the processes for lending and leasing military equipment more efficient, this bill is a strong step in the right direction to help the Ukrainians win this senseless and unprovoked war. I will continue to support strong legislation to help ensure that Ukraine maintains its sovereignty and democracy, free from Russian aggression. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417-10.</span></p></div></div></div><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><div class="WordSection1"><p><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><strong>April 27, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7314, the AXIS Ac</span><span>t.

The Secretary of State shall also appoint a Campaign Director in preparation for the International Telecommunication Union election. The threat of artificially inexpensive Chinese 5G telecommunications systems from state-directed companies like Huawei and ZTE poses serious challenges to international security. The U.S. and our allies must rise to the occasion to counter the Chinese Communist Party’s high-tech predation. </span></span><span><span>This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 366-60.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7311, the Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act.

Iran is one of the world’s worst state-sponsors of terror and exports its bloody ideology across the globe. This legislation strengthens sanctions on Iran by clarifying that existing sanctions on Iran as part of section 107 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act apply to the supply, sale, or transfer of “unmanned combat aerial vehicles” to or from Iran. </span><span>This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 424-2.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4693, the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act. Countless individuals face malnutrition across the globe. This bill </span></span><span><span>authorizes the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to engage in efforts to prevent and treat malnutrition across the globe. This will be accomplished through the targeting of resources for the most vulnerable populations, as well as increasing intervention coverage, advancing evidence-based programs, and supporting partner governments among other efforts. The legislation further authorizes the USAID Administrator is authorized to formulate a Nutrition Leadership Council. This act also contains a 7-year sunset provision. </span></span><span><span>This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 384-44.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 812, a bill to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to regain observer status for Taiwan in the World Health Organization (WHO).

To combat this aggression, this legislation d</span></span><span><span>irects the Department of State to compile information regarding Taiwan’s participation as an observer in the WHO’s World Health Assembly (WHA). More specifically, this report will catalogue any changes/improvements to State’s plan to support Taiwan’s role in the World Health Assembly, as well as keep track regarding any meetings during which Taiwan did not participate. China has historically opposed Taiwan’s involvement in the WHA.  </span></span><span><span>This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 425-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>April 26, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 497, the American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act. This legislation directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the Department of Commerce to establish an American Fisheries Advisory Committee. This committee will be comprised of six regional representatives from across the nation, who will work to identify the needs of fishing communities, develop requests for grant program proposals, review grant applications, and provide these applications for NOAA approval. The legislation will help improve NOAAs award approval process and ensure that the full range of America’s fishing communities have a seat at the table. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 404 - 11.<br /><br /><strong>April 7, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted "No" on H.R. 3807, the Relief of Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Business Act of 2022. </span><span>I am a cosponsor of legislation, H.R. 4568, that would replenish funds for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) while making key reforms to the program to ensure it actually works for New York’s small business owners. Unfortunately, the bill considered today failed to address the program’s deficiencies, which far too many small businesses have experienced firsthand. My key concern continues to be that the RRF program awarded grants unconstitutionally based on race, gender, and additional priority criteria, rather than ensuring those most in need received assistance. This meant that more than 70% of the restaurateurs who applied for the grants did not receive funding simply because many of them did not meet the program’s unconstitutional and woke criteria. This was wrong then, and it continues to be wrong now. A lack of equal opportunity in the program means that many of those who truly need help will still not receive it. Regrettably, H.R. 3807 did not fix these fundamental issues.</span><span> </span><span>That’s why </span><span>I am a cosponsor of the Entrée Act, which </span><span>I mentioned above. This is a responsible alternative to this legislation that would eliminate woke criteria that is keeping aid out of the hands of struggling restaurant owners across the country. </span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 223 – 203.</span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7108, the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act. This bill would suspend permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with Russia and Belarus. It would only allow the President to resume normal trade relations on a temporary basis of one year if the President certifies to Congress that Russia and Belarus have ended all military hostilities in Ukraine</span></span></span><span><span>, <span>accept the Ukrainian government, pose no threat to any NATO member, and recognize the right of the Ukrainian people to independently and freely choose their own government. It also reauthorizes sanctions that target human rights violations and corruption with penalties like visa bans or asset freezes.</span> PNTR should not be extended to countries that engage in wanton acts of military aggression or those who do not reciprocate and deal fairly on trade matters with the United States.<span> This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 420 – 3.</span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6968, the Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act. This bill would ban imports of Russian energy</span></span></span><span><span> products<span>, including petroleum, coal, and natural gas. </span>The Act also<span> requires President Biden to submit a certification to Congress that Russia has reached an agreement for withdrawal of forces and an end to military hostilities against Ukraine, poses no immediate military threat of aggression to any NATO member, and has recognized the right of the people of Ukraine to independently and freely choose their own government, </span>prior to<span> lifting the ban. This legislation is a critical step towards holding Russia accountable for its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 413 – 9.</span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>April 6, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.Res. 1037, a </span><span>Resolution recommending that the House Of Representatives find</span><span> Peter Navaro and </span><span>Daniel Scavino, Jr., in contempt of congress. </span><span>Instead of pursuing a valid legislative purpose </span><span>and pursuing facts and truth, including about preparedness failures on January 6, 2021</span><span>, these subpoenas, like others before it, serve a political goal. They are </span><span>an attempt by the hyper-partisan January 6 Select Committee to punish political adversaries, both of whom in this instance served in the Trump Administration. </span><span>This Select Committee takes power out of the hands of the House of Representative’s standing committees of jurisdiction, which are entirely capable of conducting a thorough investigation. We should return power to these standing congressional committees that are accountable to the people, and not a body like this Select Committee, which is “bipartisan” in name only.</span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7276, the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes </span></span><span><span>Deterrence and Accountability Act.<strong></strong><span><span>This bill ensures that the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to: (1) collect, analyze, and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine that could be used in the prosecution of such crimes; and (2) deter any such crimes by making Russian military officials aware of efforts to identify and prosecute war criminals. The people of Ukraine have bravely taken up arms to defend their nation, and they should know the United States and freedom loving people around the world stand with them, and that we will continue to support their cause through sanctions and lethal aid. I applaud my colleagues for doing this important work on a strong, bipartisan basis. </span></span>I was honored to be an original cosponsor of this legislation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>April 5, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1218, the Data Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act. This legislation directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to include data on certain maternal health outcomes in its broadband health mapping tool, which is an online platform that allows users to visualize, overlay, and analyze broadband and health data at national, state, and county levels. In doing so, the FCC is required consult with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine which maternal health outcomes should be incorporated, and the Government Accountability Office must also study the effectiveness of internet connectivity in improving maternal health outcomes and other issues. This legislation will help to identify regions where high rates of poor maternal health outcomes overlap with lack of access to broadband services, helping to show where tele-health services and increased connectivity can be most effective in improving maternal health. This bill passed the House by a vote of 409 – 11.</span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2501, the Spectrum Coordination Act. This legislation will require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to address conflicts that have been detrimental to U.S. technological and economic advancement.<strong></strong>Requiring the FCC and NTIA to update their memorandum of understanding will help to better coordinate the management of spectrum in the U.S. This will benefit the deployment and development of communication technologies. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 418 – 6.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4476, the DHS Trade and Economic Security Council Act. This bill establishes a Trade and Economic Security Council within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the purposes of identifying trade and economic security risks and developing new policy recommendations. <span>This legislation would support the supervision of our nation’s trade and economic security, which is especially important as China continues to exercise its malign influence over the global economy. Improving our economic and trade security </span>is<span> also be especially helpful in light of the present conflict in Ukraine and the various economic and trade related </span>challenges<span> this and other geopolitical </span>pose to the U.S<span>. This bill passed </span>the House of Representatives by a vote of 348 – 75.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5689, the Resilient AMERICA Act. This bill<strong></strong>amends the<strong></strong>Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act by doubling the funding stream available to the National Public Infrastructure Pre-disaster Mitigation program. In addition, the bill requires unspent funds from the program to be repurposed for mitigation and resilience projects. The legislation also extends Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Grant eligibility to non-profits. BRIC funding will also be set aside to enforce the adoption of newer building codes, and wildfires, tsunamis, ice, and wildfire risks would become eligible for hazard funding. This bill also contains a Buy American provision for construction supplies such as steel. This bipartisan bill will enhance<span> a number of disaster mitigation programs that provide assistance to those whose homes are in areas of especially great risk. It would also expand the types of natural disasters for which individuals would qualify for hazard funding while simultaneously encouraging an adherence to more hazard resilient building codes. This bill passed </span>the House of Representatives by a vote of 383 – 41.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act. This bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to change the threshold for what can be classified as a small project from $35,000 to $1 million. This threshold will also be reviewed every three years to ensure it meets current needs.<strong></strong><span>The number of disaster projects that qualified as small projects used to be 95%. Unfortunately, the small project threshold has not kept pace with inflation and now only encompasse</span>s<span> approximately 25% of recovery projects. This has led to significant administrative burdens, making it harder for communities in need to receive assistance and harder for FEMA to manage the distribution of recovery funding. H.R. 5641 will correct this problem. This bill passed the </span>House of Representatives by a vote of 414 – 11.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.Res. 831, <span>Calling on the United States Government to uphold the founding democratic principles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and establish a Center for Democratic Resilience within the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</span> This resolution reaffirms the United States’ support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and calls upon the President to support the establishment of a Center for Democratic Resilience at NATO headquarters for the purposes of bolstering present and aspiring democratic nations across the globe. Since its inception, NATO has been fundamental to defending treaty partners. The establishment of a Center for Democratic Resilience within NATO will encourage the organization's mission of promoting liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This resolution reaffirms our commitment to defending key democratic principles throughout the world, which is especially important given Russia’s unlawful and unprovoked invasion. <span>This bill passed the </span>House of Representatives by a vote of 362 – 63.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>April 4, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5657, the Medical Marijuana Research Act. This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to establish a new registration process to facilitate authorized research of marijuana for medical purposes. To this end, the bill also allows for the private manufacturing and distribution of cannabis specifically for approved research purposes. Currently, the only marijuana available to be used in research legally comes from a single contract the National Institute on Drug Abuse holds with the University of Mississippi. These restrictions hold back some research into the medical uses of marijuana for treatment of pain, childhood epilepsy therapy, and other conditions. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 343-75. <br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1916, the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act. This bill requires that private health insurance plans cover diagnosis and treatment of congenital anomalies and birth defects, such as reconstructive services. Coverage must include services and items that functionally improve, repair, or restore any body part that is medically necessary for normal bodily functions or appearance. Coverage limits and cost-sharing requirements for such services and items may not be more restrictive than those applicable to all medical and surgical benefits under a plan. Importantly, this bill<em> </em>would close a coverage gap to ensure that health plans cover medically necessary services related to medical anomalies at birth allowing impacted babies to grow into healthier adults and avoid the need for additional treatments throughout their lives. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 310-110. <br /><br /><strong>April 1, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 3617, the MORE Act. This legislation would recklessly legalize cannabis without enacting any industry standards, like those existing in the alcohol industry, to protect children and our communities. Individual states would be left to sort out issues typically reserved for federal agencies and regulatory bodies, such as labeling requirements and safety instructions. The bill also levies a cannabis excise tax that would be directed at providing relief to communities impacted by the war on drugs, but completely ignores the need to crack down on illegal operators or help communities impacted by unprecedented levels of drug use. This bill was rushed through Congress and its impact is not fully known, which is why the legislation authorizes numerous studies on the impacts of marijuana legalization. Such studies, however, should be conducted before passage, not during. This proves how rushed and poorly thought through this bill was - this issue would benefit from far more discussion and revision. In the face of decades high inflation, unaffordable energy prices, and the offshoring of American jobs to China, it is outrageous that Congress is not laser focused  on solving these issues but instead is voting on poorly written far-left cannabis legislation. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-204.</span><br /><br /><strong>March 31, 2022</strong><br />
I voted No on H.R. 6833, the so-called Affordable Insulin Now Act. This bill is a misguided attempt by House Democrats to address a serious problem but in a manner that falls well short of meaningfully lowering insulin prices for Americans. I opposed the bill because it will not fix the serious issue of high insulin costs, but instead simply shift those costs to higher health insurance premiums. In addition, I opposed the bill because it inexplicably delays the Trump Administration’s Medicare Part D rebate rule, which would have ensured that drug rebates are directed to patients rather than to the pockets of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) who are responsible for negotiating drug prices between insurance companies and pharmacies. Over the past 10 years, the actual cost of insulin has gone down; however, the amount consumers pay has continued to rise as PBMs deepen their pockets and widen their profit margins. The problem is clear: PBMs are enriching themselves at the expense of Americans who need to access life-sustaining drugs and treatments. Unfortunately, the Affordable Insulin Now Act is a giveaway to special interests and a half-hearted messaging effort, rather than a genuine attempt to fix the cost problems or incentivize additional innovation and cost-effective solutions to diabetes care. By delaying the Trump rebate rule even further, Democrats are ensuring PBMs will continue raking in high profits while Americans are stuck footing the bill. Any solution to rising drug prices must end this exploitative practice. The Republican alternative, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, which I cosponsored, would also cap the monthly cost of insulin while keeping PBMs in check and fast-tracking new brand-name, generic, and biosimilar competitors to the marketplace, further driving down costs while increasing access. Americans need results-oriented solutions H.R. 19, not industry giveaways under the guise of patient protections like the bill considered today in the House. This bill was passed by a vote of 232-193.<br /><br /><strong>March 30, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 5706, the Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in Transportation Act, which would massively expand government control over the private sector. The bill requires transportation carriers, such as passenger airlines, cruise ships, ridesharing companies, passenger railroads, transit agencies, and certain bus companies, to create formal sexual harassment and sexual assault policies, trainings, and reporting requirements. It also directs the Department of Transportation to collect information on the number of reported instances of sexual assault and harassment by each of these entities and will make such information publicly available. Finally, it will establish civil penalties for those who engage in such behavior. Sexual harassment and sexual assault are unacceptable, which is why they are already illegal under federal law. This bill vastly expands the authority of the federal government over the private sector, and completely overlooks the fact that many companies are already taking steps to actively strengthen sexual assault and harassment policies, which is something the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found when they assessed this bill. While this bill may be well-intentioned, its impact is to expand government mandates and regulatory authority to solve a problem that is already illegal and for which the private sector is actively making progress to address. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 339-85.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on S. 2938, a bill to designate the United States Courthouse and Federal Building located at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee, Florida, as the ‘Joseph Woodrow Hatchet United States Courthouse and Federal Building.’ As a member of the 11<sup>th</sup> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Hatchet wrote the majority opinion overturning the right of students at the Duval County School System to select, by majority vote, a message or prayer to be read during their graduation ceremony. This overreaching decision violated the right of freedom of religion and had a chilling effect on American civic life. It is important as a country that we resist radical attempts to demonize faith and our nation’s strong and proud heritage of religious expression. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 361-61, with 1 member voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 5547, the Care is an Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) Act. This legislation would require entities requesting funds from the Economic Development Administration to show how their plans would increase access to care-based services, including childcare, early childhood education, disability, long-term care, and elder care as part of their Comprehensive Economic Development Strategies. While these forms of care are important, they often do not relate directly to every request for economic development assistance and will disadvantage smaller municipalities and organizations who apply for such funds. Continuously adding extraneous complexity and new mandates to applications makes it harder for worthy applicants to apply for and secure much-needed funding. The issues this bill sought to address were worthy and important, however they are not best addressed by being added to unrelated applications for funding through the Economic Development Administration. We need to make it easier for worthy applicants to apply for and secure support, not harder by continuing to vastly expand application requirements beyond what is needed to genuinely assess the impact of a funding request. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 304-122.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S.400, the William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Department of Transportation Headquarters Act. This bill names the U.S. DOT headquarters after William T. Coleman and Norman Y. Mineta. Coleman was the first African American Secretary of Transportation and Mineta was the first Asian American Secretary of Transportation. Secretary Coleman was also a WWII veteran, civil rights leader, and U.S. Supreme Court clerk. Mr. Mineta is the longest serving Secretary of Transportation since the Department was established. This legislation honors their work as trailblazers and extensive service to the public. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417 – 4.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5673, the Safeguarding Tomorrow Through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Technical Corrections Act. This bill provides technical amendments to the existing FEMA hazard mitigation revolving loan fund program within the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which assists state and tribal governments finance mitigation projects. This amends fund rules by requiring that FEMA capitalization grant recipients carry out the two most recent editions for relevant building codes, specifications, and standards. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 402 – 24.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5343, the FEMA Caseworkers Accountability Act. This bill will require FEMA to submit a report regarding the rate of turnover for casework staff, as well as what actions FEMA is engaging in to reduce the rate of turnover. This report shall also include statistics on the average length of employment of case management and agency staff working on disaster recovery. FEMA has experienced significant staffing challenges, and this information will help Congress and the agency best understand and address caseworker related issues. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 409 – 17.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 2126, a bill to designate the Federal Office Building located at 308 W. 21<sup>st</sup> Street in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as the “Louisa Swain Federal Office Building.”<strong></strong>This bill renames the previously stated Federal Office Building in honor of Louisa Swain. Ms. Swain was the first woman to vote in Wyoming after the state recognized a women’s right to vote. She did so in 1870, 50 years before women’s suffrage was recognized universally across the United States. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 412 – 1, with one member voting present.<br /><br /><span>I voted “No” on S. 1226, to designate the United States courthouse located at 1501 North 6<sup>th</sup> Street in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as the ‘Sylvia H. Rambo United States Courthouse.” This bill would have renamed the previously stated U.S. courthouse after Judge Sylvia H. Rambo, a Senior U.S. District Court Judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania who was appointed by President Carter. </span>While I recognize and applaud Judge Rambo’s personal accomplishments, as <span>co-chair of the House Election Integrity Caucus, I am troubled by </span>her<span> record </span>of failing to meaningfully scrutinize rushed election changes that were made in Pennsylvania, which have since come under scrutiny by other courts at the state level. It is vital that all government officials – whether appointed judges or elected officials – always work to protect the fairness, integrity, and accountability of elections.<span> This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 364 – 61, with one member voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 29, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R .6865, the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act, which would reauthorize the Coast Guard and the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). This legislation would also amend operational and personnel activities of the Coast Guard, institute sexual assault and harassment procedures for the Coast Guard and update shipping regulations enforced by the FMC, granting the FMC authority to set certain service standards and prohibit unreasonable and unjust late fees. This increased level of support would enhance Coast Guard operations and help the Service replace and modernize its cutters, and shoreside and cyber infrastructure. This bill would help ensure that the dedicated men and women of the United States Coast Guard have the necessary resources to fulfill their critical mission. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 378-46.</span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2954, the Securing a Strong Retirement Act. This legislation would expand the automatic enrollment of workers in employee-sponsored savings plan and delay the age when retirees must begin taking distributions from their accounts. Workers would be automatically opted in unless they choose to opt out. In addition, it would raise the age for taking required minimum distributions (RMD) from 72 to 75, allowing retirees to grow their accounts more. The penalty for a person not taking their RMD would also be lowered from 50% to 25%. Finally, it would allow employers to match a worker’s student loan payment by making an equivalent contribution to their retirement savings plan. These changes would make it easier for Americans to save for retirement and enjoy their golden years. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 414-5.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 2629, the Better Cybercrime Metrics Act. This legislation requires the FBI to report cybercrime metrics just as they would for other property crimes. The bill also encourages local and federal law enforcement agencies to report cybercrime to the FBI. Further, the bill authorizes a study at the National Academies for Science to create a classification system for cybercrime incidents with the assistance of federal, state, local and tribal stakeholders as well as criminologists and business leaders. Lastly, this bill requires the Bureau of Justice and Statistics at the Department of Justice and the Census Bureau to include cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime related questions as part of the National Climate Victimization Survey. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 377-48.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3359, the Homicide Victims’ Families’ Rights Act grants the relatives of homicide victims the right to have the federal case file reviewed after the case has gone cold for three years. The assigned federal investigator may then choose to initiate a full reinvestigation if it is believed that doing so would result in further leads. This bill also requires the federal government to inform these relatives of their rights to have the case reviewed and share any updates upon review. Data regarding the issues with each of these cold cases shall also be collected. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 406-20.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4738, the COVID-19 American History Project Act. This bill directs the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress to establish a COVID-19 American History Project. This shall be accomplished by collecting individual stories and experiences of individuals within the United States from throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This bill also requires the collection of video and audio recordings of personal testimonies for those affected by the pandemic. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 376-47.</span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 28, 2022</strong><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 1621, the Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act. This legislation prohibits federal courts from considering acquittals that a defendant has received in a prior ruling. However, the bill contains an exception under which this information can be used to mitigate a defendant’s sentence. In doing so, the bill limits the courts’ sentencing power and ability to consider the full range of information that may be available. This legislation takes the wrong approach, particularly at a time when New Yorkers and all Americans are rightly concerned with recidivism rates and the increasing prevalence of violent criminals being acquitted by radical judges and activist District Attorneys in their communities. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 405-12.</span></span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 3294, which directs the placement in the Capitol or on the Capitol Grounds of two statues; one to honor Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Sandra Day O’Connor and the other to honor Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Ruth Bader Ginsburg. This legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously, would pay tribute to two female Supreme Court justices, appointed by presidents from both parties, who served our nation. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 349-63.</span></span><span><span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 18, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” H.R. 2116, CROWN Act of 2022. Discrimination against anyone is wrong, which is why the Civil Rights Act of 1966 rightfully bans discrimination based on race, color, or national origin for employment, public accommodations, and housing. While supporters of this bill argue there is a need to explicitly ban discrimination on hair texture or hair style, this bill simply duplicates civil rights protections already included in federal law while opening commonsense good-faith workplace standards to burdensome and potentially frivolous litigation. The courts have repeatedly found that grooming and appearance policies applied in a discriminatory manner clearly violate existing federal laws. In turn, this language change may ban job-critical standards such as ensuring a firefighter’s hair does not infringe on the proper functioning of their respirator. Overall, this legislation is far too sweeping and top down. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 235 - 189.<br /><br /><strong>March 17, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7108, the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act. This bill would </span><span>end the current special trade status, known as “Most Favored Nation Status,” which America provides to Russia and Belarus until the President can certify to Congress that both countries have ended their violent and unprovoked war against Ukraine. It would also grant the President the authority to proclaim increases to duty rates on products from Russia and Belarus. In addition, the bill would require the U.S. Trade Representative to use the voice and influence of the U.S. at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to condemn the recent aggression against Ukraine, encourage other WTO members to suspend trade concessions to Russia and Belarus, consider further steps to suspend Russia's participation in the WTO, and seek to halt the accession process of Belarus at the WTO and cease accession-related work. Given Russia’s violent and unprovoked war against Ukraine, and Belarus’ unjustifiable assistance, the United States must use the economic and diplomatic tools at our disposal to stand for those suffering from Vladimir Putin’s aggression. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 424 – 8.</span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 963, the FAIR Act. This </span></span></span><span><span>misleadingly titled <span>bill would amend Title 9 of the U.S. code to outlaw pre-dispute arbitration agreements for employment, consumer, antitrust, civil rights dispute, and other contractual language limiting participation in joint, class, or collective action litigation in these areas. </span>However, the bill includes a special carveout for labor unions, allowing them<span> to use pre-dispute arbitration agreements</span> even after they are prohibited for everyone else<span>. This bill also would widen the definition of civil rights dispute to cover any federal, state, or local law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. This could open employers to ruinous liability in unfriendly states and localities for operating their businesses in a manner consistent with their consciences or sincerely held religious beliefs. Overall, this legislation is a giveaway to trial lawyers and risks burying businesses in expensive litigation and legal costs</span> without meaningfully protecting workers<span>. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 221 – 209.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 16, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3167, the Save the Liberty Theatre Act of 2021. The Liberty Theatre in Eunice, Louisiana has been a staple of the Cajun community for over 100 years, hosting silent films, live bands, and other entertainment. Currently, the National Park Service (NPS) owns a portion of the venue constructed to provide a handicap entrance. This shared ownership structure has recently hindered the city’s efforts to restore the theatre. The legislation will transfer this ownership share to the city of Eunice and allow for the renewal of this local landmark. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 422-4.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3167, to designate the El Paso Community Healing Garden National Memorial. </span></span><span><span>On August 3rd, 2019, El Paso was the tragically target of a horrific act of domestic terrorism by an eco-terrorist that took 23 lives and injured 22. Following the attack, the County of El Paso approved the construction of the El Paso Community Healing Garden to provide El Pasoans a space to heal and remember the victims and survivors. The memorial will not be a unit of the national park system and designation does not require or authorize any Federal funds to be expended for the memorial. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 403-25.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 6434, the Japanese American WWII History Network Act, which will preserve our history and its lessons for future generations. This legislation </span></span><span><span>extends the authorization for the existing Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) grant program, which will soon run up against its original authorization cap. Since its creation, the JACS Grant Program has awarded 269 grants for projects to private nonprofit organizations; educational intuitions; and state, local, and tribal governments for the preservation and interpretation of the World War II Japanese internment camps. The bill also establishes a new competitive grant program to award grants to Japanese American organizations to create and disseminate educational materials about the history of Japanese American confinement during World War II. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 406-16.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 15, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3113, the Modernizing Access to Our Public Land Act. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Currently, more than 9.52 million acres of land in the Western United States lack permanent and legal access points for public use, and information on these lands is still kept on outdated, hard to access paper files. This prevents countless hunters, anglers, and millions of other Americans from easily accessing these public lands. Even today, only 5,000 of the Forest Service’s 37,000 recorded easements have been digitized and uploaded to an electronic database. This legislation will direct federal land management agencies to finally digitize and standardize these maps. These modernized practices will improve public access to federal lands, enhance visitor safety, reduce conflicts between recreationists and private landowners, and aid land management agencies in prioritizing projects to acquire new access points and improve existing access. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 414-9.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5001, the Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins Recovery Act. This bill authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to the continue the implementation of endangered fish recovery programs for the Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins through 2024 in order to protect and recover endangered fishes while water development proceeds in compliance with State and Federal laws. This important program, which employs a partnership of local, state, and federal agencies, water and power interests, and environmental groups, was established to help bring back several species of endangered fish from the brink of extinction and extending the program will help them complete this mission. America’s wildlife and natural beauty are our heritage, and it is important that we preserve them for our children. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 397 – 27.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 9, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “No” on the non-defense portion of the Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act. After failing to pass a bipartisan, long-term funding package three separate times since the end of the last fiscal year, House Democrats continue their abject failure at responsible governance. The 2,700-page, $1.5 trillion omnibus bill to fund the government through the end of September was released in the dead of night, leaving Members of Congress virtually no time to read its text, let alone seriously analyze its contents. This is no way to govern. Unfortunately, the non-security portion of the omnibus package fails to address the severe crises facing our country, while wastefully increasing spending in many areas at a time when inflation is already at record levels. The bill does not defund President Biden’s vaccine mandates and does nothing to jumpstart American energy production, despite the unprecedented energy crisis we now face. Further, it includes a 21% increase in budgets for congressional offices, while not taking a single meaningful step to help seniors and those on fixed incomes who are desperate for relief because of Biden’s inflationary policies. While I could not support this portion of the bill given these very serious issues, I am nonetheless pleased that the underlying text included several Community Funding Projects I tirelessly advocated for in Congress. This includes a water systems improvement project in Frankfort, a broadband expansion project in Sherburne, among several others. I vetted these programs thoroughly and worked with all recipients to make sure the funding requests were targeted and responsible. I am extremely disappointed these important priorities were tied to a partisan spending package that overall is irresponsible and reckless. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 260 – 171.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on the defense portion of the Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act. I supported the defense portion of this omnibus package because it included important priorities for our national defense, like a 5.6% increase in defense spending and a 2.7% pay increase for our troops. I also fought hard to secure an additional $30 million in funding for the Air Force Research Lab in Rome, which will lead to significantly more resources for Central New York’s high-tech eco-system. The brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also received an increase of $800 million, and the bill included targeted and much-needed security assistance to Ukraine. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 361 – 69.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted </span></span><span>“Yes”<span> on H.R. 6968</span>, the <span>Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act. This bill would block all imports from Russia of oil, gas, coal, and other energy products under Chapter 27 of the tariff code.<em> </em>It would also reauthorize and expand the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and remove its sunset. In addition, the bill would direct the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to use the voice and influence of the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to condemn the recent aggression in Ukraine, to encourage other WTO members to suspend trade concessions to Russia and consider further steps to suspend Russia’s membership in the WTO. Although this legislation was not as strong as an earlier bipartisan agreement </span>I strongly supported, which was inexplicably <span>abandoned by Democratic leadership at the last </span>minute<span>, </span>this bill<span> is</span> nonetheless<span> a step in the right direction to stop funding Putin’s war machine.</span><span><span>This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 414 – 17.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 8, 2022</strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5681, the Shadow Wolves Enhancement Act. This legislation would authorize the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to reclassify officers of the Shadow Wolves from tactical enforcement officers to Special Agents upon the completion of specialized training, including federal criminal investigator training and customs enforcement training. Shadow Wolves are “a Native American tactical patrol unit assigned to Homeland Security Investigations.” The unit specializes in the interception of human and drug smugglers in a border territory of 8 million acres and a 76-mile stretch of land shared with Mexico. This status change will increase the unit’s capabilities and help them retain talent, rewarding them for their work keeping our nation and borders safe. This bill passed the House by a vote of 387-33.</span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.ConRes. 70, condemning threats of violence against historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and reaffirming support for historically Black colleges and their students. </span><span>On three separate occasion this year (Jan. 5, Jan. 31, and Feb. 1) bomb threats were made to a total of over 25 HBCUs across the country. The FBI is currently investigating these vile threats as racially motivated hate crimes. As of now no suspects have been publicly identified. H. Con. Res. 70 condemns violence and threats of violence against HBCUs, including these recent bomb threats, and reaffirms the federal government’s commitment against hate and to the rule of law. This bill passed the House by a unanimous vote of 418-0.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>March 7, 2020</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5616, the DHS Basic Training Accreditation Improvement Act. This bill requires reporting by the Secretary of Homeland Security to Congress on the accreditation status of each of the Department’s basic training programs. For programs not accredited, the Secretary would be required to provide reasons for the lack of accreditation, the activities taken to achieve accreditation, and the timeline for the accreditation of the program. Ensuring these basic training programs are up-to-par is critical to our national security and will make our country safer. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 390 – 33.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 658, the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act. This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to work with the National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium (NCPC) to help prepare for and respond to cybersecurity risks at the national, state, and local levels. It would authorize DHS to work with the NCPC to provide training to state and local first responders and officials, develop curriculums, provide technical assistance, conduct cross-sector cybersecurity training and simulation exercises, develop cybersecurity information sharing programs, and incorporate cybersecurity risk and incident prevention and response into existing state and local emergency plans and continuity of operations plans. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 403 – 19.<br /><br /><strong>March 3, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 3967, the Honoring our PACT Act of 2021.<strong> </strong>I strongly support efforts to deliver much-needed relief to Veterans suffering from exposure to toxins. Congress has been working for years to craft targeted legislation to provide support and assistance to veterans. Unfortunately, the bill considered today in the House politicized the issue and was a partisan effort to score points, rather than support our veterans. First, this bill could severely increase wait times at the VA for veterans, as the VA has not yet testified to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs about its ability to implement the legislation, and estimates suggest that the backlog of cases at the VA could grow to as many as 1.53 million claims by the end of Fiscal Year 2023. Rushing a bill through Congress that is not even implementable is bad enough, but doing so when we know this bill could increase wait times for veterans at a very significant cost is absolutely inexcusable. I firmly believe that every veteran exposed to toxins deserves the health care that we promised them when they signed up for service to our nation. As the mother of a Marine officer, this issue truly is a personal one for me. And there is a way to provide this expanded care for veterans effectively today – the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act is a bipartisan bill that I strongly support and voted in favor of as an amendment in place of the Honoring our PACT Act. This commonsense bill has already passed the Senate unanimously and would deliver immediate relief to veterans, without increasing wait times and jeopardizing other vital services. Unfortunately, instead of considering this legislation, Speaker Pelosi instead chose to move forward with the Honoring our PACT Act. It is deeply disheartening how the Democrat majority in the House continues to play politics with our veterans. Instead of delaying access to lifesaving care any longer, Speaker Pelosi can, and should, take up the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act as soon as possible and send it to President Biden for his signature. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 256 - 174.<br /><br /><strong>March 2, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.Res. 956, Supporting the People of Ukraine. This resolution expresses support for the people of Ukraine, calling specifically for an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, affirming our support for the nation’s citizens and the imposition of sanctions against Russia, and reaffirming our support for Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Further, this resolution promises to provide additional aid and humanitarian relief to Ukrainian refugees, as well as work with Europe to strengthen its energy security and reduce dependence on Russian energy imports. Congress should act where the president has failed to deter Putin’s belligerence. The United States must hit Putin where it hurts by imposing severe sanctions and diplomatic consequences for this unprovoked aggression, as well as reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine and to the Ukrainian people. We must stand with the people of Ukraine in their struggle for freedom, democracy, and peace. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 426 - 3.<br /><br /><strong>February 28, 2022</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.321, the “Six Triple Eight” Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2021, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the members of the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) who were assigned to the all-African-American, all-female comprised 6888th Postal Directory Battalion. This was the only all-African-American, all-female battalion to serve during the World War II. The 6888th Battalion existed from November 1944 until March 9, 1946, serving in Birmingham, England and Rouen, France during this time. These women deserve great praise for their selfless service and sacrifice for our nation. During a time of immense challenge, their bravery helped keep morale high by ensuring American soldiers were connected to their loved ones. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 422 – 0.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 55, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. This bill designates lynching as a federal hate crime and imposes strict criminal penalties, such as prison time, a fine, or both, for violators. Lynching was an evil practice far too common throughout the United States until the 1960s, and this legislation will help close the book on that ugly chapter of our Nation’s history. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 422 – 3.<br /><br />
I voted “No” H.R. 2116, CROWN Act of 2022. Discrimination against anyone is wrong, which is why the Civil Rights Act of 1966 rightfully bans discrimination based on race, color, or national origin for employment, public accommodations, and housing. While supporters of this bill argue there is a need to explicitly ban discrimination on hair texture or hair style, this bill simply duplicates civil rights protections already included in federal law while opening commonsense good-faith workplace standards to burdensome and potentially frivolous litigation. The courts have repeatedly found that grooming and appearance policies applied in a discriminatory manner clearly violate existing federal laws. In turn, this language change may ban job-critical standards such as ensuring a firefighter’s hair does not infringe on the proper functioning of their respirator. Overall, this legislation is far too sweeping and top down. This bill required a 2/3 majority to pass the House and failed by a vote of 235 - 188.<br /><br /><strong>February 9, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act. While the bill purports to protect LGBT identifying individuals abroad, sufficient legal authority already exists to sanction groups or individuals who commit human rights violations against these individuals. Both the Trump and Biden Administrations have taken such actions. The bill’s duplicitous language creates a new reporting mechanism that prioritizes the rights of particular groups. Every person’s human rights are of equal value, and certain violations of those rights should not be subordinate to others. Furthermore, the bill’s broad language has the potential to sweep in non-violent conduct and even leaves the door open to imposing visa restrictions on individuals for their deeply held religious beliefs. This legislation represents the Administration’s aggressive attempts to push radical culture war issues at every possible juncture – not only domestically, but also abroad. This is a distraction that requires diplomats to devote time and resources to culture war issues abroad at the expense of attention paid to China, to Russia, to Iran, to the quagmire in Afghanistan, and the crisis at our southern border. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 227 - 206.<br /><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3539, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 223 West Chalan Santo Papa in Hagatna, Guam, as the "Atanasio Taitano Perez Post Office." Commonly known as Don Perez, Don was a highly successful public servant for Guam from 1899 to 1935. He held key government positions over many US Naval government administrations including appointment as the first Postmaster of Guam, appointment to the Guam Court of Appeals and the Higher Court of Equality, and Secretary to the Governor. In addition to government service, Perez was also personally involved in the movement petitioning Congress to establish a permanent civilian government and United States Citizenship for the people of Guam. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 417– 1.<br /><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 2842, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 120 4th Street in Petaluma, California, as the "Lynn C. Woolsey Post Office Building." Congresswoman Woolsey represented California's sixth congressional district from 1993 to 2012, during which time she served as co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and misused the power of her office to seek leniency for the son of one of her staffers who had pleaded guilty to the violent rape of a 17-year-old girl. Instead of naming Post Office facilities after partisan politicians who misused their offices, this honor should be reserved for those who made extraordinary contributions to their communities. This bill required a 2/3 vote to pass the House of Representatives and failed by a vote of 245 – 167.</span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>February 8, 2022</strong><span><br /><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act, a bill which I am honored to cosponsor. This bipartisan bill will make several much-needed substantive reforms to the United States Postal Service (USPS). First, it eliminates the requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits 75 years into the future, which USPS estimates will save more than $20 billion over the next 10 years. Instead future retirees will be integrated into Medicare. Second, It creates an online dashboard with weekly performance data from both the local and national levels. Finally, it expands special rates for local newspaper distribution, and it codifies 6-day-per-week service. This legislation will help ensure USPS can continue to provide critical services to our communities, like delivering prescriptions to seniors and packages for small businesses and farmers, for generations to come. This bill</span><span></span>passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 342 - 92.</span></span><span></span><br /><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 6617, Further Additional Extending Government Funding Act.<strong></strong>This continuing resolution, the third since government funding expired on September 30, 2021, would only extend government funding through March 11, 2022. Once again, House Democrats are abdicating their responsibility to pass a long-term, bipartisan government funding package that addresses our nation’s needs. Failing to do this means key defense installations in NY-22, such as Rome Lab, have not received the additional funds they vitally need, our troops continue to miss out on a pay raise, and our military’s competitiveness dwindles in the face of competition from China and Putin’s aggression. Furthermore, the legislation includes no new provisions to deal with the many challenges facing our country. It fails to address the Biden Administration’s incompetence in dealing with the crisis on our Southern Border. It does not stop the Administration from flying illegal immigrants around the country. And it does not prohibit Biden from imposing his vaccine mandate on millions of Americans, denying them final say over their individual medical decisions. <span>This bill </span><span>passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 272 - 162.<br /><br /><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 566, a bill to designate the facility </span></span><strong><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>of the United States Postal Service located at 42 Main Street in Slatersville, Rhode Island, as the "Specialist Matthew R. Turcotte Post Office." Specialist Turcotte was serving with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Infantry Brigade Combat team of the 4<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division when he was killed in August of 2017, at just 20 years old, during a live-ammunition training exercise at Fort Carson, Colorado. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 432 – 0.</span></span></span></span><strong><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></strong></span></span><br /><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2324, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2800 South Adams Street in Tallahassee, Florida, as the "D. Edwina Stephens Post Office." Edwina Stephens was a dedicated community activist, civil rights icon and registered nurse. She spent her life advocating for improvements in her community, especially in the historically neglected neighborhoods on Tallahassee’s Southside and in the Greater Bond community. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 428 - 1.</span></span><br /><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 735, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 502 East Cotati Avenue in Cotati, California, as the "Arthur Luis Ibleto Post Office Building." At just 17, Art Ibleto deserted Benito Mussolini's fascist army to join the Italian resistance movement and fought behind enemy lines to help the Allies defeat Nazi Germany during World War II. In 1949, he left Italy for Petaluma, California where he met his wife and settled in Cotati. Art Ibleto was a famed member of the Sonoma County food and wine community known as the Pasta King and was an incredible leader in local charitable, educational and civic causes. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 422 - 4.</span></span><br /><br /><strong>February 7, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act. This bipartisan legislation would invalidate forced arbitration clauses for sexual assault and sexual harassment. These clauses are often buried in the fine print of employment agreements as well as digital click-through “terms and conditions” agreements. Banning these restrictions will fully allow everyday Americans to have the choice to seek justice and public accountability for their sexual assault and sexual harassment case in a court of law. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 335 - 97.</span><br /><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 583, the Promoting Rigorous and Innovative Cost Efficiencies for Federal Procurement and Acquisitions Act (PRICE Act). Small businesses are the backbone of our Upstate New York economy but many of them have difficulties contracting with the federal government. This legislation will resolve this by requiring the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to work with federal acquisition managers to share innovate best practices to modernize contracting procedures, realize cost saving for taxpayers, and ensure small businesses have a seat at the table in federal contracting. For high quality and reliable government services, it is vital to ensure our public sector has a robust marketplace of contractors to rely on. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 426 - 5. </span><br /><br /><strong>February 4, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 4521, the misnamed and partisan America COMPETES Act. House Democrats, following the lead of Speaker Pelosi, took an area of bipartisan agreement and urgent national need and used it as leverage to cynically push forth unrelated liberal priorities and poison pills. Despite being branded as legislation to compete with a rising China, the bill fails to address the full range of threats and national security concerns posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Instead of addressing critical needs, such as security assistance, export controls, and supporting our allies facing CCP aggression, the America COMPETES Act is full of wasteful spending and new left-wing programs that will only make America less competitive on the world stage. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 222-210.</span><br /><br /><strong>February 1, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted "Yes" on H.R. 5577, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3900 Crown Road Southwest in Atlanta, Georgia, as the "John R. Lewis Post Office Building."<span> Lewis was a lifelong civil rights activist and spent 33 years representing his community in the United States House of Representatives. Congressman Lewis was </span><span>instrumental</span><span> in organizing the 1963 March on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. and was a key figure throughout the Civil Rights Movement and in the push to end racial segregation in the South. </span><span>I was proud to support this bill as a cosponsor. </span>This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 421 - 0.</span><br /><br /><strong>January 20, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act.<strong></strong>This bill would direct the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to automatically enroll eligible separating servicemembers into the VA healthcare system. The VA then would be required to notify veterans of their enrollment status and information on how to disenroll, if they would like. I am firmly committed to ensuring all eligible veterans can easily access quality care through the VA. However, this bill would enroll veterans in the VA care system without their knowledge or consent leading to confusion, administrative burdens, and potential costs and disruptions for veterans. It also could have a significant impact on wait times, funding, staffing, and infrastructure needs. Congress does not yet fully understand its impacts since there has not been a hearing on the bill during the 117<sup>th  </sup>Congress, barring the VA and Members of Congress the opportunity to share input, including on whether the VA could successfully carry out the bill’s directive. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 265 – 163.</span><br /><br /><strong>January 19, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on S.452, “t</span><span>o award a Congressional Gold Medal to Willie O'Ree, in recognition of his extraordinary contributions and commitment to hockey, inclusion, and recreational opportunity.”</span><span></span><span>Willie O’Ree was the first black player in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played as a winger for the Boston Bruins in the 1960-61 season. O’Ree is often referred to as the “Jackie Robinson of ice hockey” for breaking the color barrier and opening opportunities for future players and hockey enthusiasts around the world. In 1998, he became the NHL’s Director of Youth Development and an ambassador for the NHL Diversity program, allowing him to travel throughout North America to promote grassroots hockey programs and open the sport to disadvantaged children. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 426-0.</span><br /><br /><strong>January 18, 2022</strong><br /><span>I voted “Yes” on S. 2959, the Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act. This bipartisan bill will allow schools that disproportionally serve military families, Native American communities, and areas with a high proportion of federal land to have the resources they need to provide for their students. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these schools had large fluctuations in student numbers, threating their access to federal Impact Aid Program funds. This bipartisan bill will allow these schools to use previously reported headcounts so they can continue paying for staff salaries, student transportation, education technology, social emotional supports for students, and more. After the upheaval of the past two years, we need commonsense flexibly to allow our children to get back to normal and return to the classroom. This bill passed the House by a vote of </span><span>414-6</span><span>.</span><br /><br /><strong>January 13, 2022</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on Concurring in the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746. This amendment focused on election reform was added in the dead of night to completely unrelated (and bipartisan!) NASA legislation. It is a cynical attempt by House Democrats to diminish the voting power of law-abiding American citizens. The legislation would federalize elections, even though Article 1 Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution clearly protects the rights of states to determine voting laws and practices. The legislation is an unconstitutional power-grab that would ban voter identification rules, mandate ballot harvesting, give the American people’s hard-earned tax dollars to political campaigns they do not agree with, and open the door for all noncitizens to vote. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 220-203.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>January 12, 2022</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021. As the mother of a Marine officer, I understand the sacrifices made by our service members and their families. One of my top priorities in Congress has always been to make sure that every American service member and veteran is well-equipped and properly taken care of, both while they are serving and after they return to civilian life. <span><span>Unfortunately, <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>while this bill may have been well-intentioned, it never truly received a hearing or due consideration in the Veterans Affairs Committee.

It would cost tens of billions of dollars in mandatory spending without any offsets, threatening other vital Veterans priorities and programs, such as toxic exposure legislation. <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It also would extend Department of Veterans’ Affairs Home Loan housing fees and would increase the fee for Interest Rate Reduction Refinanced Loans.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 287 – 135. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div></blockquote><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>December 14, 2021</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted "No" on S.J. Res. 33 – to raise the debt limit by $2.5 trillion. Since re-taking power, Democrats in Congress have engaged on a wasteful partisan spending spree despite record inflation and significant economic challenges at home. Instead of reigning-in spending and enacting policies to actually improve the lives of Americans, Democrats amassing an enormous tab for future generations, who will be saddled with these financial burdens. This measure is an attempt to clear the way for even more debt-financed federal spending on destructive programs. It is a blank check enabling Democrats to push through their $3 trillion harmful socialist spending package. </span></span><span>This legislation passed the House by a vote of 221-209.</span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 5665, the Combatting International Islamophobia Act. No person should face discrimination, whether it is based on their race, color, religion, or sex. Thankfully, this is why we have anti-discrimination protections in law as well as federal programs to fight discrimination and hate abroad. This bill however is simply a bad-faith messaging bill by Democrats, who are aiming to duplicate existing programs without any input across the aisle. Furthermore, the legislation avoids defining “Islamophobia,” leaving it completely up to interpretation of unelected bureaucrats. Republicans in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on which I serve, tried to fix this shortcoming, but were unfortunately rejected by Democrats. This bill passed the House by a vote of 219-212.</span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.Res. 851, a resolution to find Mark Meadows, a former Member of the House of Representatives and Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, in contempt of Congress for allegedly failing to respond to a subpoena issued by the Select Committee and refers him to the Department of Justice for prosecution. Meadows made good faith efforts to cooperate with the Select Committee for months, while maintaining his assertions of executive privilege.  Meadows produced nearly 7,000 pages of non-privileged emails and other documents that were outside the scope of his executive privilege claim. Mr. Meadows filed suit on December 8, 2021, in federal district court to stop the Committee’s overreach, and protect his assertions of executive privilege and testimonial immunity. Until the court rules on the merits of those claims, it is clearly inappropriate for Congress to find Mr. Meadows in contempt and refer him for prosecution. This bill passed the House by a vote of 222-208.</span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>December 9, 2021</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 5314, the blatantly partisan so-called Protecting Our Democracy Act. This bill is nothing more than political grandstanding by Congressman Adam Schiff and congressional Democrats, who wrote this wide-ranging legislation without any bipartisan input. After four years of Congressman Adam Schiff using his privileged position as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee to mislead the American people, lying that he had seen confidential material that proved President Trump was colluding with Russia, he is now trying to pass this legislation to cover up his own unethical behavior. While I do support protecting the powers of Congress and reinforcing our checks and balances, this bill is nothing more than a shameless targeting of former President Trump and cannot be mistaken as a serious attempt to legislate. This bill passed the House by a vote of 220-208.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>December 8, 2021</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4996, Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>. This bill provides expanded authorities to the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), which regulates ocean shipping, to protect and ensure fairness for U.S. shippers who import and export items from the United States. It </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>increases protections for U.S. shippers from retaliation by foreign ocean carriers if shippers file a complaint with the FMC. The legislation also prohibits foreign ocean carriers from unreasonably denying the carriage of U.S. export cargo on foreign ocean carriers’ vessels if such cargo is available, can be loaded safely, and is going to a destination on the ship’s schedule. This bill passed the House by a vote of 364-60.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4616, Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>. After the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) scandal in 2012 and changes in the way banks currently loan to each other, it was decided that the LIBOR will be phased out as of December 3</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>1<span>, 2021. However, as the benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one other, this rate undermines many existing financial contracts that underpin our financial system. This bill works to promote a smooth transition away from LIBOR by promoting legal certainty, consistency and limiting legal disputes. It will achieve this through establishing a process for certain financial contracts that reference the LIBOR and do not contain sufficient language that would allow them to continue to function as originally intended after LIBOR is discontinued, to instead reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or an appropriately adjusted form of SOFR without the need to be amended or subject to litigation.

This bill c</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>reates a library for cattle contracts within the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Agriculture Marketing Service. Currently, cattlemen are unaware of many of the contract terms being offered by packers, leading to a decline in leverage for smaller producers during price negotiations. The USDA maintains a pork contract library and following significant volatility in the cattle market as well as the release of USDA’s 2020 Boxed Beef &amp; Fed Cattle Price Spread Investigation Report, the creation of a library was recommended by experts and stakeholders. These reasonable changes will be especially helpful for many of our small and family run farms in Central New York and the Southern Tier.

Our region is home to such rich natural beauty, and it is incumbent upon each of us to protect and preserve the outdoors and our environment for future generations. However, this bill would bypass Congress, allowing the Forest Service to collect and keep the interest earned on settlement funds. It would in essence create another mandatory Federal spending program in the complete control of federal bureaucrats, not Congress. Taxpayer dollars are precious, and every American deserves a voice and input on how they are spent and that they are managed responsibly.

It tragically causes stumbling, listlessness and other neurological symptoms.<span> Half of the appropriated funding would support CWD research to develop testing methods, enhance detection efforts, and better understand genetic resistance. The other half would support the management of CWD by prioritizing funding for state and tribal wildlife agencies that have the highest incidence of CWD, are demonstrating the most significant commitments to combatting CWD, are facing the greatest risk of new CWD cases, and more. </span>These additional efforts will play an important part in boosting the health of our wildlife for the benefit of all.

Over the past few years, it has become increasing apparent that China is committing crimes against humanity in their western Xinjiang province, sending countless members of the Uygur minority to “reeducation” camps and using them as slaves to produce products ranging from apparel to electronics. </span></span></span></span><span><span>This bill would prohibit the import of goods produced in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) with forced labor, absent “clear and convincing” evidence showing the goods were not made with such labor.

I voted “Yes” on H.Res. 837, to express the sense of the House of Representatives that the International Olympic Committee failed to adhere to its own human rights commitments. </span></span></span></span><span><span>This commonsense and simple resolution expresses that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) did not adhere to its own human rights commitments by cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party and not protecting the free speech of Olympic athletes. It also recognizes their failure to protect athletes from sexual abuse or harassment. These failures have become very evident with the IOC’s handling of the alleged confinement and muzzling of the elite Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, in which they wittingly played into the Chinese Communist Party’s unbelievable position that she was not violated by a senior government official or was being retaliated against for speaking out.

Specifically, this bill creates a public-private partnership for rare neurodegenerative diseases at HHS to streamline the development and approval of new therapies and establishes a rare neurodegenerative grant program at FDA. These conditions affect far too many great individuals and families nationwide and I cosponsored this legislation to ensure we can help them with these targeted investments to improve their quality of life and develop cures.

This legislation, which funds the federal government until February 18, 2022, does not deal with any of the challenges facing our nation, including the border crisis, inflation, and vaccine mandates. This continuing resolution provides appropriations for the disastrous policies of the Biden Administration, which are leaving Americans worse off economically and infringing on our liberties. I cannot support legislation that allows for the continuation of open borders policies, vaccine mandates, and other government failures.

This bill would require the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to submit to Congress a report on the state of cyber security of U.S.-based mobile communications networks, the vulnerabilities that could affect these networks, and available countermeasures or best practices. It is vital that threats and risks to our carriers, communities, and national security are identified and addressed.

This bill would require financial disclosure reports to be made publicly available online and require federal judges to submit periodic transaction reports of securities transactions in line with other federal officials under the STOCK Act. It also provides the needed nuance to allow judges to limit certain details that may lead to security concerns.

This bill would amend the Indian Reorganization Act to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court case <em>Carcieri v. Salazar </em>and make it easier for the Secretary of Interior to take private land into trust for a greater number of federally recognized Indian tribes. These powers would infringe on the rights of local governments and communities, depriving them of local control and needed tax revenue.

This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on actions taken by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address social determinants of health, especially how data collection about social determinants of health complies with privacy laws. Social determinants of health are nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes, such as income, education attainment, and place of residence.

What’s more astonishing is House Democrats still have no idea how many of the bill’s provisions and new programs will even function. The so called Build Back Better Act is a handout to communist China that will raise taxes on small businesses, hurt Upstate farms, and drag government into every aspect of family life. This hodgepodge of Green New Deal wish list items and subsidies for special interests undermines our free-market system and erodes the great American spirit of entrepreneurship and opportunity. I reject this bill and the one-party rule in Washington that delivered it.

I voted “No” on H.Res. 789, Censuring Representative Paul Gosar. This resolution is a shallow, partisan political stunt that skirts congressional ethics procedures in an attempt by Nancy Pelosi to infringe on the rights of the minority party to seat its members on congressional committees. This is a harmful precedent that will only lead to additional dysfunction and partisanship in the future. Speaker Pelosi continues to undermine and erode the democratic process, First Amendment rights, and trust in the sacred institution of Congress. Pelosi spearheaded two sham impeachment trials, boosted the Russia collusion hoax, and has repeatedly ignored actual calls for violence by members of her party. Now, she wants to play judge, jury, and executioner in a cynical partisan ploy, throwing both precedent and the longstanding rules of the House out the door. The Speaker lacks the moral authority and support of the American people. I condemn political violence, but that is clearly not what this vote was about.

Under this bill, student veterans and service members who receive GI Bill benefits and other education assistance could request readjustment counseling and mental health services at Vet Centers. The services are currently available to eligible veterans and service members and their families, including those who served in combat or in response to a national emergency. Additionally, this bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report on the mental health needs of veterans pursuing education programs using VA education benefits, and department efforts to address those needs, within one year of enactment.

The bill expands an existing monthly housing stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill by authorizing the stipend to be used for other purposes. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in coordination with Labor, must establish a publicly accessible and user-friendly website on which veterans can find specified information about apprenticeship programs that are approved under VA education benefit provisions.

Today I voted “No” on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684, a $1.2 trillion Green New Deal inspired spending bonanza also misleadingly named the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This legislation ignores core national infrastructure needs, and instead authorizes massive spending for carelessly crafted programs that will force out private infrastructure investment and promote the far left’s climate and social agendas. The bill is also a Trojan horse enabling passage of the multi-trillion-dollar budget reconciliation bill authored by socialist Senator Bernie Sanders, which will significantly expand the role of the U.S. federal government into every corner of the private sphere, while raising taxes on hardworking New Yorkers. Any truly bipartisan investment in our Nation’s infrastructure must be built on a framework of cutting red tape, incentivizing long-term private sector investment, and meeting the needs of everyday Americans. However, this legislation fails to deliver these needs on all accounts. With only ten percent of the spending going to roads and bridges, it lacks the targeted infrastructure investment needed to improve the quality of life in our area. The current text is simply a vehicle to further redistribute wealth from our underinvested rural communities to well-off urban centers. This bill unfortunately passed the House by a vote of 228-206.<br /><br /><strong>November 4, 2021</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 3992, the Protect Older Job Applicants Act (POJA) of 2021. Any discrimination in the workplace is unacceptable and discrimination against older workers is already illegal under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Thanks to these protections older Americans are experiencing greater opportunities in the workplace, with the employment of workers over 65 tripling over the past three decades. However, this legislation would radically expand the definition of discrimination, including neutral polices that happen to inadvertently benefit a certain group. That redefining would threaten common employer practices such as sponsoring high school and university job fairs, online jobs recruitment programs, internships, and apprenticeships—reducing opportunities for all workers. It would also unleash trial lawyers to attack small businesses and employers with frivolous lawsuits.

This bill would allow entities to receive funding for hazard mitigation, including the acquisition of property or relocation of structures for projects where planning or construction began before a grant was awarded. As a commonsense limitation, any projects normally required to undergo an environmental impact review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) will be exempt from this retroactive funding. In addition, if the grant is not awarded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the applying entity will be responsible for project costs. These reforms will give our local communities flexibility to quickly recover from a disaster.

I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1339, the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act. This bill would require the Secretary of Transportation to establish an interagency working group consisting of individuals from nine federal agencies to examine policies around the advanced air mobility (AAM) industry. The group would be required to work with the civil aviation industry and state and local governments to develop recommendations on safety, infrastructure, physical security, cybersecurity, and federal investment to be presented to Congress. Any findings will be important for policy makers to adjust federal air policy for future needs.

These grants could be used for: planning, technical assistance, or training; land acquisition or development; acquisition, construction, or improvement of facilities. As a rural district lacking adequate broadband access and choice, this will help many residents of the 22<sup>nd</sup> District.

Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs) are conducted so FEMA can determine the magnitude of damage and impact of disasters. This bill will require FEMA to create a panel including federal, state, and local officials to determine how to improve the process and report to Congress on their findings and propose legislative action. The information from this report will help the federal government ensure they dispatch needed resources adequately to affected areas.

This only applies to leases entered into on or after January 1, 2021 and if Congress specifically provides for the purchase in a subsequent act of Congress. It is important we act as a responsible guardian of taxpayer funds, and this is an important step in that direction.

This bill would include the Sequoyah Museum, the Chota Memorial, and the Tanasi Memorial in Tennessee into the existing land trust of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. These lands host important cultural institutions and historical sites for the tribe, and they will be banned from allowing gambling. As existing non-profits, the local communities will not suffer lost tax revenue from their inclusion in the land trust.

Over the past few years, the federal government, including the Small Business Administration (SBA), has been the target of cyber-attacks, some of which have successfully undermined the privacy of Americans. This bill would require the SBA to produce an annual report on its information technology (IT) and cybersecurity infrastructure. The report would need to include a strategy on increasing cybersecurity infrastructure, an account of equipment manufactured by Chinese companies, and an account of cybersecurity incidents at the SBA within the past previous two years.

The Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 7(a) loan program is a federal program that leverages the private sector and community banks to expand capital to small businesses at an affordable rate. Over the past two years, these loans have taken on even more importance, allowing employers to stay solvent during the pandemic. However, while the SBA can currently track loans originating from lenders it cannot do the same for loans originating from loan brokers. I cosponsored this legislation to fix this shortcoming, allowing policy makers to track the effectiveness of loan brokers, and enabling the SBA to spot fraud. This bill passed the House by a vote of 407-9.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> <br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4531, the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight Act. This bill would order the Office of Credit Risk Management to create an annual report including essential metrics about the success and shortcomings of the Small Business Administration’s 7(a) Loan program for small businesses. This report will provide greater oversight over 7(a) loan agents and their lending practices, giving policy makers better guidance on how to best improve the program. This bill passed the House by a vote of 411-9.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4515, the Small Business Development Center Cyber Training Act of 2021. As we have seen over the past year, having robust cybersecurity protection is essential for any company. A successful cybersecurity breach can cost a business thousands of dollars and has been tied to a higher risk of business failure. However, many businesses do not know where to start in enacting cybersecurity procedures. Therefore, I cosponsored this bipartisan legislation to direct the Small Business Administration (SBA) to require Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) to have trained and certified staff to provide cybersecurity counseling. It also would reimburse the SBDC’s certification costs up to $350,000. These steps are an important part in making our nation safe from these crimes. This bill passed the House by a vote of 407-16.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>November 1, 2021</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 1619, the Catawba Indian Nation Lands Act, which would take private lands into federal trust for the purpose of the Catawba Nation building a casino. This federal action would undermine the impacted communities, depriving them of local control and tax revenue. There are alternative remedies the tribe could have taken without undermining local sovereignty, such as a direct agreement with their state and local communities. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 361-55 with 3 members voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.R. 2758, the Lumbee Recognition Act. This legislation would bypass the normal Office of Federal Acknowledgement review process at the Department of Interior, to fully recognize the tribe and pave the way for them to request a federal trust to build a casino on. Bypassing this long-established channel would allow the tribe to avoid an assessment by experts, historians, and genealogists in order to review their documentation and historical tie to the land. It is essential that we uphold this essential oversight function and ensure all recognition petitions are properly reviewed. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 357-59 with 1 member voting present.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /><br /><strong>October 28, 2021</strong><br /><span>Today I voted “Yes” on H.R. 5763, the Further Surface Transportation Extension Act. Unfortunately, a month after voting for a short-term reauthorization of federal highway programs, we are once again voting for another short-term one-month reauthorization rather that a long-term bipartisan bill. This is not the way to govern. Our communities need the long-term stability of knowing their highway and road projects will be able to move forward and not held up by partisan squabbles. The only people to blame for this frustrating process are Speaker Pelosi and President Biden. They are holding hostage this essential funding in order to have the leverage to force through a far-left agenda most Americans do not even support.</span><span> I urge Speaker Pelosi to abandon this partisan approach and work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to immediately pass a bipartisan one-year surface transportation reauthorization that excludes partisan riders and poison pills. This bill passed the House by a vote of 358-59.</span> </p><p><strong>October 27, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 1502, the COPS Counseling Act of 2021. This bill will support privacy and care for law enforcement officers by prohibiting the disclosure to third parties of the contents of a peer support communication within counseling programs provided by a law enforcement agency for its officers. It also will require the Department of Justice to develop best practices and professional standards for peer support counseling programs. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 424-3.</p><p>I voted “Yes” on S. 1511, the Protecting America’s First Responders Act of 2021.<strong> </strong>This bill will improve the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program, which provides death and education benefits to survivors of fallen law enforcement officers, as well as disability benefits to first responders catastrophically injured in the line of duty. It will update the program’s definition of disability to ensure that officers permanently unable to secure meaningful employment following a catastrophic injury in the line of duty remain eligible for benefits. Finally, the legislation also expands DOJ’s subpoena authority to more efficiently secure records needed to evaluate claims, which will cut down on delays in processing claims. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 420-3.<br /><br /><strong>October 26, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 2119, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act. This legislation reauthorizes the Family Violence and Prevention Services (FVPSA) program through 2026 at a level of $270 million annually. Although in previous years FVPSA reauthorization was widely bipartisan, Democrats in Congress have now added multiple poison-pill partisan provisions to this legislation. Specifically, they included changes that pave the way for taxpayer funding of abortion and to prevent religious institutions that do not support Democrat social priorities from receiving funds to provide domestic violence services. While an amendment was proposed to reinsert pro-life protections, this measure was ultimately voted down. As such, I could not support the final bill, which was too critically flawed. This legislation passed by a vote of 228-200.<br /><br /><strong>October 25, 2021</strong><br /><span>I voted "Yes" on H.R. 4111, the Sovereign Debt Contract Capacity Act. This bill would direct the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund to advocate that the Fund promote international standards and best practices for sovereign debt contracts and provide technical assistance to members, especially lower middle-income countries and countries eligible to receive assistance from the International Development Association. This will help lower middle-income nations evaluate the legal and financial terms of sovereign debt contracts with multilateral, bilateral, and private sector creditors. This bill passed the House by a vote of 319-29.</span><br /><span><span><span><span><span><br /><span>I voted "Yes" </span></span></span></span></span></span><span>on H.R. 2989, the Financial Transparency Act, to require all financial regulators in the United States to adopt a new, modernized set of data collection and distribution standards for information collected under current law. This would include the implementation of electronic forms to replace outdated paper ones. It also would make all data available in an open-source format that is searchable and downloadable without license restrictions. This bill passed the House by a vote of 400-19.</span></p><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><div class="WordSection1"><p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p></div></div></blockquote><p><strong>October 22, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “No” on H.R. 3110, the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act. This legislation would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to add new rigid requirements for employers to provide a non-bathroom location and time for women to pump breastmilk for up to two years after the birth of a child. Currently twenty states, including New York, have a similar requirement. In addition, hourly employees are already covered under current federal law. This bill also dramatically expands penalties for employers who are unable to accommodate these new requirements. As written, this top-down rule unfortunately does not account for the specific limitations of certain workplaces such as the agriculture industry. Its expansive mandate and lack of clarity would also open employers to additional frivolous lawsuits. While this legislation is well intentioned, we need a more well-thought out, targeted solution that gives workplaces the flexibility to succeed and empower their workers. This bill passed the House by a vote of 276-149. <br /><br /><strong>October 21, 2021</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “No” on H.Res. 730, a Resolution recommending that the House of Representatives find Stephen K. Bannon in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by the Select Committee to Investigate the </span></span></span><span><span>January 6th<span> Attack on the United States Capitol.  Instead of pursuing a valid legislative purpose, this subpoena serves a partisan goal and targets a private citizen, threatening his First Amendment rights. This Select Committee takes power out of the hands of the House of Representative’s standing committees of jurisdiction, which are entirely capable of conducting a thorough investigation. We should return power to these standing congressional committees and not a body like this Select Committee, which is highly partisan and in fact “bipartisan” in name only. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 229-202.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong>October 20, 2021</strong><br /><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4611, the DHS Software Supply Chain Risk Management Act.

Unfortunately, due to mismanagement by Speaker Pelosi, authorization for federal highway programs expired midnight on Thursday. This resulted in the furloughing of 3,700 federal employees and the halting of multiple highway and road projects funded through the highway trust fund. All this disruption could have been easily avoided by a vote earlier this week, however House Democrats were too focused on ramming through their own liberal agenda. This legislation thankfully will provide a clean bipartisan extension of funding for the next 30 days so these essential programs and projects can resume.

The bill also includes provisions completely unrelated to government funding, such as providing benefits and Real IDs to Afghan nationals at the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, who I recently called on to resign for his failure to secure our southern border. I could not support a funding bill that concealed deeply flawed policy provisions without even the opportunity for debate or amendments.

In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, this includes cyber-related jobs such as data scientists and computer engineers to handle cybersecurity, respond to hacks and other digital-crises, and fulfill other critical needs.

Today I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3599, the Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act. Over the past years we have learned the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to guard the privacy of Americans and safeguard critical infrastructure. This bill will create a Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program within the Office of Personnel Management to allow cybersecurity personnel in federal agencies to do temporary rotations in other government agencies. These placements will increase communication between the different agencies, allowing them to share cybersecurity tactics and best practices more easily. This bill passed the House by a vote of 410-15.</p><p>I voted "No" on H.R. 1204, the District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer Home Rule Act, which would allow the DC Government to irresponsibly increase the salary of the DC Chief Financial Officer at the cost of taxpayers. This bill required a 2/3 majority to pass and failed in the House by a vote of 259-170.<br /><br />
I voted "No" on the House Amendment to S. 1301, that gives a blank check to Speaker Pelosi, completely suspending the debt limit until December 2022. In the past, Republicans and Democrats have come together multiple times to raise the debt ceiling. However, this time Speaker Pelosi has again completely cut House Republicans out of the process, forcing through a bill that would clear the way for her multi-trillion-dollar deficit fueled takeover of the American economy. It would be deeply irresponsible to clear the way for a plan so out of step with the priorities of the American people. This bill passed the House by a vote of 219-212.<br /><br /><strong>September 28, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 1693, the EQUAL Act. While I understand the intent of this legislation, it did not include meaningful input provided from the law enforcement community or adequately address their concerns. Crack cocaine is generally more accessible in communities and reducing penalties for those arrested with crack cocaine could make it harder for law enforcement to keep these drugs off the streets. With violent crime at a multi-decade high, this is the wrong time for us to take important tools away from our brave officers. This bill passed the House by a vote of 361-66.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4981, to amend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act. This bill amends the previous Fentanyl Sanctions Act by extending certain deadlines, allowing the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking more time to develop solutions to combat the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States. This bill passed the House by a vote of 410-14.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4250, the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act. This bill provides the Department of State with more resources to authorize rewards for information that may lead to the arrest, conviction, or extradition of foreign nationals wanted for alleged war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity. This bill passed the House by a vote of 412-9. </p><p>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1228, the Libya Stabilization Act. The conflict in Libya has seen horrific human rights abuses and the collapse of democracy. This bill authorizes U.S. sanctions against persons who contribute, directly or indirectly, to the violence in Libya. Additionally, the bill calls for humanitarian assistance to those suffering from the side effects of the conflict, including food, shelter, and medical care. This bill passed the House by a vote of 386-35.</p><p>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4686, the Cambodia Democracy Act. Cambodia is suffering from extensive government corruption that undermines democracy and contributes to a deteriorating human rights situation. This bill urges the President to impose sanctions on the senior Cambodian officials and military personnel responsible for these autrocities. This bill passed the House by a vote of 403-17.</p><p>I voted “Yes” on S. 848, the Consider Teachers Act. For the past 12 years many recipients of the TEACH Grant program have been hit by unexpected debt as small administrative errors turned their grants into loans that must be paid back with interest. This is unfair to these recipients, who serve as teachers in high-need, often underserved communities. As a solution, this legislation will fix the problem, providing more flexibility and efficiency in the TEACH grant program so these grant dollars can be used more effectively with less bureaucracy. This bill passed the House by a vote of 406-16.</p><p>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1154, the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area Act, to direct the Secretary of the Interior to assess the sustainability and feasibility of creating a study area known as the Great Swamp National Heritage Area throughout Virginia and North Carolina. This study would determine whether the area has natural, historic and cultural resources representing different aspects of the people and culture of the United States, and whether it is worthy of recognition and continued use. This bill passed the House by a vote of 391-36.</p><p>I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2617, the Performance Enhancement Reform Act. This bill would reform the process for drafting performance goals for federal agencies, increasing collaboration and improving how the government delivers resources to the American people. This legislation will integrate direct feedback from key stakeholders, improving services for American families and small businesses. This bill passed the House by a vote of 414-10.</p><p><strong>September 24, 2021</strong><br />
Today, I voted “No” on H.R. 3755, the misleadingly named Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021. This radical bill is nothing more than a veiled attempt to upend current federal and state limitations on abortion in order to allow abortion on demand until birth. It would also fully legalize discriminatory abortions on the basis of the baby’s sex, race and disability. Contrary to its title, this legislation would remove protections for women such as laws shielding women from coerced abortions and laws requiring parental involvement for minors. Finally, it undermines the foundational American values of freedom of religion and belief, weakening conscience protections that shield medical professionals if they refuse to participate in an abortion. These radical proposals are wrong and completely out of step with the views of the American people. This partisan bill passed the House by a vote of 218-211.</p><p><strong>September 23, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4350, FY22 National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation provides our military with the resources it needs to defend the nation, supports servicemembers, and hold the Administration accountable for its disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Specifically, the bill reverses President Biden’s reckless cuts to our national security by boosting the defense topline by nearly $25 billion, ensuring growth of 5% of FY21. It also authorizes a 2.7% pay increase for servicemembers and extends military recruitment and retention bonuses and special pay authorities. This year’s NDAA prohibits the dishonorable discharge for servicemembers who refuse COVID-19 vaccinations, prohibits the funding of medical research in China, and includes vital provisions requiring transparency over the lifting of sanctions on Iran. The NDAA will help safeguard the United States, counter threats, and support our service men and women. While I did not agree with every provision in this bill, its passage prioritizes policies to strengthen our defenses, improve readiness, and advance research and development that will give our military forces critical advantages. Importantly, it included six of my amendments to boost investments in quantum computing in Rome, hold Iran accountable, and counter China’s malign activity. This legislation passed by a vote of 316-113.</p><p><strong>September 21, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “Yes” on S. 1828, the HAVANA Act. This bill provides additional financial assistance to American public servants suffering from “Havana Syndrome.” Since 2016, more than 40 U.S. Embassy staff in Havana, at least a dozen U.S. diplomats at the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, and several more around the world have incurred brain injuries from likely directed energy attacks. This bill will provide the CIA Director and U.S. Secretary of State with the authorities they need to properly assist those U.S. personnel affected. It is important these “Havana Syndrome” victims are not tied up in endless bureaucracy and are able to receive the care and compensation they deserve. This bill passed the House by a vote of 427-0.</p><p>Today I also voted “No” on H.R. 5305, the Extending Government Funding and Delivery Emergency Assistance Act, a short-term spending bill that also raises the debt limit. In the past Democrats and Republicans have come together to address the debt ceiling and fund the government, however Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer have prioritized their bitterly partisan agenda that completely shuts Republicans out of the legislative process. This legislation would suspend the debt limit through December 2022, giving Speaker Pelosi a blank check to add trillions to our national debt and raise taxes on hardworking New Yorkers. In addition, it also cuts $1 billion for Israel’s Iron Dome program, an important defensive technology used to protect innocent civilians from rocket attacks, including American citizens in Israel. This is another example of the far-left driving the House Democrats’ priorities. It is absolutely wrong for Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to oppose Israel’s right to self-defense. If Democrats want to unilaterally push these terrible proposals forward and add trillions to our national debt without input, accountability, or transparency, then they bear the sole responsibility of addressing the consequences of their disastrous policies. This bill passed the House by a vote of 220-211.</p><p> </p><p><strong>September 20, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “Yes” H.R. 5293, the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2021. This bill will ensure that our veterans have continued access to crucial VA benefits. This includes much-needed services like dental insurance and travel to health appointments.  This bipartisan legislation was passed by a vote of 423-0. </p><p>Today I voted “Yes” on S. 189, the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021. This bill will increase the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities, as well as the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for eligible survivors of disabled veterans. Especially with high increases to the cost of living over the past several months, our veterans need this help now more than ever. This bipartisan legislation was passed by a vote of 423-0.<br /><br /><strong>August 24, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “No” on S. Con. Res. 14, a resolution to initiate the reconciliation process for the Democrat’s $3.5 trillion spending plan. It is astonishing that at a time when Americans are facing skyrocketing inflation, Speaker Pelosi and many in Congress believe the appropriate solution is to raise taxes and force Americans to pay for one of the most expensive and wasteful spending bills in our nation’s history. This bill will advance a far-left social agenda, including the Green New Deal, mass amnesty, and an unparalleled expansion of the welfare state. In addition, it will also undermine the long-term viability of Medicare and increase taxes on our small businesses. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 220-212.<br /><br />
Today I voted “No” on H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The unconstitutional proposal undermines the integrity of our elections. The bill would overturn the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling in <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>, which effectively struck down the half-century old, outdated coverage formulas under Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. It would also provide federal bureaucrats with veto power over commonsense voter ID laws and other safeguards to protect our sacred right to vote. Overall, this legislation is a sweeping power grab over elections, handing the power over voting laws from democratically accountable local officials to unelected federal bureaucrats in Washington. Because this bill is so bad for American democracy, Speaker Pelosi rushed it through the House of Representatives without a single committee hearing and never provided Members of Congress the opportunity to meaningfully change the bill through the amendment process.  This bill passed the House by a vote of 220-212.<br /><br /><strong>August 23, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “Yes” on S. 325, to amend the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children Act. This bipartisan bill would extend the deadline for the commission’s report on native children by two years, giving the commission more time to develop recommendations on how to improve federal efforts and programs that benefit these youth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the commission was not able to host in person hearings and listening sessions to gather public input. This extension is necessary to ensure the findings are appropriate and accurate. This bill passed the House by a vote of 418-7.<br /><br />
Today I voted “Yes” on S. 272, the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act. This commonsense bill would require full transparency with taxpayer money, directing the heads of federal agencies to regularly publish details on their agency’s funding and spending on their website. Americans deserve to know how their taxes are being spent and this bill is an important step toward maximizing government transparency. This bill passed the House by a vote of 423-1.<br /><br /><strong>July 29, 2021</strong><br />
Today, I voted “No” on H.R. 4502, the Fiscal Year 2022 Minibus Appropriations Package. This bill irresponsibly increases discretionary spending by almost 20% while cutting defense spending significantly when accounting for inflation. These spending increases are on top of the $1.9 trillion partisan funding package Democrats already pushed through Congress just a few months ago, billions of which currently remain unspent. This bill also drops longstanding pro-life provisions such as the Hyde and Weldon Amendments, rolling back protections for health care professionals who do not wish to participate in abortions and requiring taxpayer funds to be spent on elective abortions for the first time since 1976. In addition, this package will undermine our nation’s energy independence and make it harder to source critical minerals domestically, increasing our reliances on adversaries like China for the rare earth elements we need to manufacture batteries, electronics, and solar panels. Finally, it includes several provisions that will undermine our immigration laws, allowing non-citizens to receive federal student aid and preventing the Department of Homeland Security from accessing the necessary information to enforce our laws and deport criminals. In a period with the highest inflation in 14 years and when small businesses and families are already suffering because of the Biden Adminsitration’s policies, we should be focused on proven solutions, not more failed progressive legislation that will worsen the current situation. This bill passed the House by a vote of 219-208.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2278, which would allow for the creation of a “September 11th National Memorial Trail Route”. The trail will connect the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York to the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial in Arlington, Virginia and to the Flight 93 National Memorial in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. We must never forget the most horrific terrorist attack ever to take place on American soil. This legislation will provide a proper tribute to those lives lost and serve as a reminder of our Nation’s resilience in the face of overwhelming adversity and fear. This bill passed the House by a vote of 423-0.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2497, the Amache National Historical Site Act. This bipartisan bill establishes the Amache National Historic Site in Colorado as a unit of the National Park System. This will allow us to preserve and protect the site as well as teach future generations about its historical significance. This bill passed the House by a vote of 416-2.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 4300, the Alexander Lofgren VIP Act. This legislation will make the America the Beautiful Pass, which provides access to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites, including national parks and national wildlife refuges, free to our active-duty service members, veterans, and Gold Star Families. After putting so much on the line to defend our great Nation, our military and veterans should have the liberty to enjoy our federal recreation sites free of charge. I was honored to support this bipartisan legislation. This bill passed the House by a vote of 420-0.<br /><br /><strong>July 28, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2022. This extremely partisan bill includes dangerously unprecedented funding increases while advancing unnecessary, progressive policy provisions. This bill alone includes a 12% increase over current levels, with $3 billion directed to climate change programs like the green climate fund, with little oversight or accountability. In addition, this bill includes alarming changes to long-standing language to protect the life of the unborn. Specifically, language that prohibits foreign aid from being used to pay for abortions was omitted entirely. The bill also includes other controversial changes, such as a permanent repeal of the Mexico City policy, which prohibits organizations that receive foreign assistance from performing abortions. Instead of working to craft bipartisan legislation for FY22 that Members on both sides of the aisle can support, Democrats chose to put forward a State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that is based on unrealistic and irresponsible funding levels and partisan policy provisions. This legislation was adopted by a vote of 217-212.<br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 4346, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2022. I was deeply troubled by this partisan bill, which was reported out of the Appropriations Committee without a single Republican vote. House Democrats included massive spending increases at a time when our National Debt is approaching $29 trillion and without addressing the debt ceiling, which we are quickly approaching. H.R. 4346 includes a $582 million increase over this year’s spending levels and follows a budget outline that increases overall non-defense spending by a whopping 17%, while slashing defense spending when accounting for inflation. This partisan bill puts our Nation in an even more dangerous fiscal situation, fails to make meaningful reforms to the Capitol Police Board, and even allows Congress to hire illegal immigrants for the first time ever. I remain committed to a reasonable, bipartisan spending bill that puts our Nation back on a path to fiscal sanity. This bill unfortunately failed to meet that mark. It was bloated and included unnecessary, partisan policy provisions. This legislation was adopted by a vote of 215-207.<br /><br /><strong>July 27, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.957 - To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that certain medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have physical locations for the disposal of controlled substances medications. This bipartisan bill will allow everyone in a community to use drop boxes at VA medical centers to dispose of unused controlled substance prescription medications. This bill will give our communities a way to safely get unneeded opioids off the street. It is an important step in combating the opioid epidemic and making our communities safer. This bill passed the House by a vote of 424-0. Having already passed the Senate, the bill will now head to the President to be signed into law.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S. 1910, the Major Medical Facility Authorization Act. This bipartisan bill will authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to move forward with projects at a select group of facilities to make these locations safer, more modern, and better able to meet the medical needs of veterans. Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a strong advocate for our veterans and ensuring the Department of Veterans Affairs spends its funds with the highest level of accountability. These commonsense projects authorized today will ensure veterans can access reliable, quality healthcare. This bill passed the House by a vote of 413-7. Having already passed the Senate, the bill will now head to the President to be signed into law.<br /><br /><strong>July 26, 2021</strong><br />
Today<strong></strong>I voted “No” on the Motion to Table H.Res. 554. As I’ve said before, this is the first time in our Nation’s history that a Speaker of the House has blocked members of the minority party from serving on a Select Committee. Speaker Pelosi’s decision sets a terrible precedent for the House and makes clear that her priority from the start has been to preserve her power. While the Senate has produced bipartisan assessments of the events on January 6, Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leaders in the House have done nothing but play politics. Speaker Pelosi’s decision proves once again that she has no intention of overseeing a process that is fair or fact-based. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 218-197.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1664. This bill authorizes the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to establish a commemorative work on Federal land in Washington D.C to honor the extraordinary acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice of Medal of Honor recipients. This legislation will allow generations to reflect on the honorable sacrifice and courage that our servicemembers have made in defense of our nation and freedom. This bill passed the House by a vote of 416-0.<br /><br />
Today I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2365. This bipartisan bill will extend the authorization for the establishment of a Gold Star Families Monument, which expired in January 2020. The monument will be built on federal land in Washington, D.C. by the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation at no cost to the taxpayers. Our Gold Star Families have given so much for to the protection of our country and sacred freedoms, it is important that we remember their sacrifice. This bill passed the House by a vote of 412-0.<br /><br /><strong>July 22, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3985, the Allies Act. This bill ensures that Afghan interpreters and other allies who faithfully supported the U.S mission in Afghanistan are not left behind, while providing Congress with the necessary tools and authorities to conduct oversight of the program as needed. This legislation makes available 8,000 additional visas for the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program and revises some requirements of the application process so that qualifying translators are not incorrectly or unfairly denied visas. Afghans who bravely stood by and assisted U.S. forces in Afghanistan have been and continue to be threatened and targeted by the Taliban. It is critical to protect the lives of the many Afghans and their families who faithfully worked side-by-side with U.S. forces over the years. The legislation passed by a vote of 407-16.<br /><br /><strong>July 21, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “Yes” on H.R.2467, the PFAS Action Act of 2021. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are large class of man-made chemicals that are very persistent in the environment—meaning they can often last for decades. Some of these substances can accumulate in the body over time and cause adverse health effects such as thyroid disorders and cancer. This bill will require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate the dangerous, already commercially phased-out, PFOA and PFOS chemicals as hazardous substances, making areas with high contamination a priority for clean-up under the EPA’s Superfund program. Before being phased out, these chemicals were formerly used in firefighting foam and some water-repellents and are often found contaminating the areas around airports, industrial sites, and military bases like the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome. In addition, this bill will require the EPA to do health testing on PFAS chemicals currently in use and will ban new PFAS chemicals from entering the market until they are proven safe for humans. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 241-183.<br /><br /><strong>July 20, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on a package of 12 bipartisan bills, which passed by a bipartisan vote of 319-105. This package includes legislation that will strengthen our transportation network’s response to future and current health crises. This legislation will also strengthen our nation’s response to cyberattacks, securing our essential infrastructure and government services from attacks by criminals or adversaries like Russia and China.<br /><br />
The list of bills included in this package is below:<br /><br /><strong>1. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1893">H.R. 1893 </a></strong>- Transportation Security Preparedness Act of 2021 <br /><strong>2. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1895">H.R. 1895 </a></strong>- Transportation Security Public Health Threat Preparedness Act of 2021 <br /><strong>3. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1877">H.R. 1877 </a></strong>- Security Screening During COVID-19 Act<br /><strong>4. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1871">H.R. 1871 </a></strong>- Transportation Security Transparency Improvement Act <br /><strong>5. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2795">H.R. 2795 </a></strong>- DHS Blue Campaign Enhancement Act<br /><strong>7. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3138">H.R. 3138 </a></strong>- State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act <br /><strong>8. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1833">H.R. 1833 </a></strong>- DHS Industrial Control Systems Capabilities Enhancement Act of 2021 <br /><strong>9. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2980">H.R. 2980 </a></strong>- Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act <br /><strong>10. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3223">H.R. 3223 </a></strong>- CISA Cyber Exercise Act <br /><strong>11. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3264">H.R. 3264 </a></strong>- Domains Critical to Homeland Security Act<br /><strong>12. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1850">H.R. 1850 </a></strong>- Supporting Research and Development for First Responders Act <br /><strong>13. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3263">H.R. 3263 </a></strong>- DHS Medical Countermeasures Act<br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R.2668, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act. This bill radically expands the power of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), while failing to take the necessary steps to establish a national privacy framework or maintain sufficient administrative guardrails and oversight measures. While this bill gives sweeping new authorities to the FTC to target American companies, it completely fails to include protections that guarantee due process rights for Americans. In addition, the bill does nothing to aid in the fight against fraudsters, scammers, and those who acquire and abuse personal information for their own gain. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 221-205.<br /><br /><strong>July 19, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “Yes” on H.R. 826, the Divided Families Reunification Act. This legislation will allow the State Department to work with the South Korean government on opportunities to reunite Korean Americans with their family members in North Korea. While the North Korean government continues to commit egregious human rights abuses and subject its citizens to absolute tyranny, the United States and its strong ally South Korea remain committed to protecting human rights and unifying families that have been kept apart for far too long. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 415-0. <br /><br /><strong>July 1, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted “No” on H.R. 3684, the Invest in America Act. Investing in our nation’s infrastructure and rural communities is among my top priorities in Congress. But it is imperative that any infrastructure bill be bipartisan and drafted through an inclusive process that takes into account the views and feedback from all Members. Unfortunately, Democrats in the House have once again abandoned a bipartisan process in favor of a highly partisan one that prioritizes Green New Deal policies over commonsense solutions to rebuild our infrastructure and reinvest in rural America. This bill would bankrupt the Highway Trust fund in two years. It steers funds away from rural areas like New York’s 22nd District toward major cities and imposes one ideological mandate after another on local governments. The bill also fails to provide communities the flexibilities they need to make targeted investments. H.R. 3684 bewilderingly takes resources away from water and wastewater infrastructure, which we desperately need in New York, and diverts them toward climate projects. These and many other misguided priorities fall completely short of fixing our collapsing roads and aging water infrastructure or delivering for rural New Yorkers. My Republican colleagues in the House have introduced a better alternative – the Surface Transportation Advanced through Reform, Technology &amp; Efficient Review (STARTER) Act. This is a fiscally-sound, long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill that provides historic levels of investment in America’s roads, bridges, and core infrastructure. It maximizes flexibility, cuts red tape, focuses on the needs of rural America, and fosters greater innovation. It is a much better bill than the one we considered today. H.R. 3684 passed the House by a vote of 221-201.<br /><br /><strong>June 30, 2021</strong><br />
Today I voted "No" on H.Res. 503, to Establish the Select Committee on January 6th.  As I have said repeatedly, condemn the unlawful acts at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. Those who threaten, destroy, and steal property betray our fundamental Constitutional rights of free speech and peaceful assembly. Congress and its committees of jurisdiction like the Homeland Security Committee are fully equipped to investigate the events of January 6. They have subpoena power and subject-matter expertise to handle the investigation. Just recently, a bipartisan Senate investigation released comprehensive findings that were the result of serious, constructive and bipartisan work amongst Senate committee staff and leadership. The House of Representatives can and should do the same, but Speaker Pelosi continues to block any meaningful bipartisan cooperation. In addition, the Architect of the Capitol has already been appropriated $10 million to conduct a comprehensive security review of its own, which is entirely nonpartisan. Further, there are ongoing investigations by the DOJ and FBI that have led to over 500 charges or arrests and yielded significant evidence related to the events. The addition of Speaker Pelosi’s select committee is an entirely partisan exercise at the taxpayer's expense. It will cherry pick the evidence to conform to the Democrat's narrative. This bill passed the House by a vote of 222-190.<br /><br /><strong>June 29, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 567, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2021. This bipartisan bill authorizes an interagency program to strengthen counterterrorism operations and better coordinate U.S. assistance to address rising extremism in West and North Africa. In the last year alone, ISIS and Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist attacks in the Sahel have more than doubled, killing over 4,000 people. A military response alone will not address this threat. That is why it’s vital for a strong, coordinated U.S. response that appropriately balances our diplomatic, development and defense efforts to build capacity in other countries to combat terrorism and address the root causes of extremism. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 395-15.<br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 2662, the Inspector General Independence and Efficiency Act. Despite its name, this bill actually fails to ensure proper protections for former federal employees or maintain the President’s authority, regardless of their party, to expeditiously remove and replace inspectors general (IG). H.R. 2662 goes so far as to limit the President’s ability to remove an IG for dereliction of duty or impropriety and unnecessarily shifts the delicate balance between the Executive Branch and Congress, including by dramatically expanding subpoena authority in a manner that could easily be misused or abused in the future. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 221-182.<br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 3005, Removing Certain Statues from the Capitol. Currently, states select two statues to be displayed in the halls of Congress. This tradition goes back to 1864, and represents the idea that our Constitutional Republic is based on the core principle of federalism. This bill would direct the removal of the bust of Roger B. Taney from the Old Supreme Court Chamber and replace it with a bust of Thurgood Marshall. It also requires the Architect of the Capitol to identify, and the Joint Committee on the Library to remove, all statues in National Statuary Hall of individuals who voluntarily served the Confederacy within 120 days, and within 45 days all other Confederate statues and busts in the Capitol. I am concerned that this bill would provide even greater power to the Joint Committee on the Library, which oversees the placement of the statues, even though this Committee has already exhibited serious bureaucratic flaws. For example, the State of North Carolina voted six years ago to replace a Confederate statue in the Capitol, yet the Committee has not taken any action to make this happen. Similarly, the State of Kansas has been waiting 22 years to put a statue of Amelia Earhart in the Capitol. This lack of action is clearly unacceptable, and suggests that the process could be politically motivated. A better approach to this issue would be to reform the Joint Committee so that it operates less arbitrarily and more effectively, while continuing to give states the ability to make these decisions through the democratic process, as they have for more than a century. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 285-120.<br /><br /><strong>June 28, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2225, the National Science Foundation for the Future Act.  This bipartisan legislation will increase funding for the National Science Foundation to ensure that industries of the future like quantum information sciences, artificial intelligence, supercomputing, cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing can continue driving our economic growth and competitiveness. The United States must dedicate more resources to research and development in these areas to foster greater innovation, improve our national security, and maintain our competitive edge over adversaries like China. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 345-67.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 3593, the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act.  This bipartisan bill provides comprehensive policy guidance and funding authorization for the major research programs overseen by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science. This includes research on materials and chemical science, bioscience, climate science, fusion energy, scientific computing, and high energy and nuclear physics. This bill also offers guidance for the Office of Science’s Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists program to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM programs. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 351-68.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 391, the Global Health Security Act of 2021. This legislation reaffirms the United States’ commitment to promoting global health security. This bill directs the President to establish the Global Health Security Agenda Interagency Review Council to review and implement the Global Health Security Agenda, an initiative launched by nearly 30 nations to address global infectious disease threats. The Global Health Security Act will ensure the U.S. can hold other nation’s accountable, while increasing our ability to prepare for and respond to public health threats, and reduce or prevent their spread across borders. This bipartisan legislation passed the House by a vote of 307-112.<br /><br /><strong>June 25, 2021</strong><br />
I voted "No" on S.J. Res. 14, the Methane CRA. Reversing the existing rule on methane, as this resolution does, will not better protect the environment, but it will harm America’s energy independence by re-establishing duplicative and burdensome regulations. This CRA reverses previous reforms and returns regulation of methane emissions to the rigid and overly burdensome framework put in place by the Obama Administration. I oppose this unnecessary and misguided bill because it will contribute to job losses and higher energy costs, while doing little to meaningfully increase environmental protections or reduce emissions, as the Environmental Protection Agency’s own estimates have established. This joint resolution passed the House by a vote of 229 – 191.<br /><br /><strong>June 24, 2021</strong><br />
Today, the House considered two bills and two Congressional Review Act (CRA) Joint Resolutions. CRA Joint Resolutions are used by Congress to overturn rules put in place by a federal agency.<br /><br />
I voted "No" on S.J. Res. 15, the True Lender CRA because reversing this existing rule would hurt community banks in our area. In October 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a final rule to clarify that a bank is the “true lender” of a loan if it is named as the lender in the loan agreement or if it funds the loan. This clarification was necessary to allow smaller community banks to partner with financial technology companies and leverage their resources to offer a broader array of services to customers in communities like ours. It also allows these institutions to increase their ability to compete with larger banks. By reversing the clarification provided by the True Lender Rule, as this joint resolution does, these banks will face uncertainty from conflicting rulings from federal courts on whether the bank or the partnering firm is the originator of the loan. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 218-208.<br /><br />
I voted "No" on H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act. I strongly support the equal rights and protections of all people, no matter their race, gender, religion, or sexuality. I have concerns that this bill could lead to preferences in the financial sector based on certain classifications. It also arbitrarily excludes certain groups of small businesses that are recognized or protected elsewhere in federal law, such as veteran-owned, Native American, and rural small businesses. As a small business owner, I have concerns whenever the government begins to arbitrarily pick winners and losers. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 252-176. I previously opposed this legislation when it was considered by the House earlier this month as well.<br /><br />
I voted "No" on S.J. Res. 13, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission CRA. This resolution overturns a rule issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that addresses the conciliation process in federal employment law as a way to resolve employment discrimination allegations through cooperation and voluntary compliance. Specifically, the rule implements reforms that will ensure the EEOC provides respondents with the essential facts and law supporting the claim, and the basis for monetary relief, so that respondents can better evaluate their liability and more promptly voluntarily remediate specific discriminatory practices. Rolling back this rule, as this joint resolution does, will make the conciliation process less effective and transparent, discourage utilization of the process, and lead to a higher percentage of discrimination charges being resolved through costly litigation. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 219-210.<br /><br />
I voted "No" on H.R. 239, the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act.  This bill prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from requiring payment from a veteran for any contraceptive item that is required to be covered by health insurance plans without a cost-sharing requirement. The bill would require taxpayers to bear the full cost of contraception through the VA, which includes forms of birth control like Plan B and Ella, which are abortifacients. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 245-181. I previously opposed this legislation when it was considered by the House earlier this month as well.<br /><br /><strong>June 23, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on a package of 16 bipartisan bills, which passed the House by a vote of 325-103. This package includes legislation that revises the Consumer Production Safety Commission’s (CPSC) safety standards for freestanding storage units and cribs, and requires the CPSC to establish a program to explore artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. The legislation will also revise the Federal Bar Association and redefine judicial districts in North Carolina. The complete list of bills included in this package is below:</p><p>1. <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__majorityleader.us9.list-2Dmanage.com_track_click-3Fu-3Df5af264d7bacb33cab2f3e314-26id-3D372712b83f-26e-3Dd56a7d6f81&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&amp;r=np9Q2o3Xsw7uaHC2SmfQfbC-IrqlpglnL67WNAy2xoc&amp;m=20Vc2tiziqv0FojbFCWWhpyptJy7xUG8wx6oCTc_0-c&amp;s=Xu5qlwJtHc56ZukiUOtmVs7iNcy5Y59iVH1JSwmHR18&amp;e=">H.R. 482</a> – Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2021<br />

I voted “No” on H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.  This bill would overturn a 2009 Supreme Court decision (<em>Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc</em>) on the basis that the decision negatively impacted age discrimination cases. Overturning this case allows a plaintiff to argue that age was only a motivating, not decisive, factor that led to an employer’s unfavorable employment action. Allowing such “mixed-motive” claims will eliminate the carefully balanced standard Congress adopted when it passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, resulting in more frivolous lawsuits. Unfortunately, H.R. 2062 disregards current law and decades of Supreme Court precedent, which will ultimately reward trial lawyers at the expense of the older American workers the legislation purports to protect. I strongly support protecting any American citizen from discrimination, including that based upon age.  However, all workers are already protected from discrimination through other legislation, and this bill would only blur the lines on the discrimination towards the elderly and create unnecessary litigation which will in turn hurt our seniors. The legislation passed the House by a vote of247-178<br /><br /><strong>June 22, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1374, the Enhancing State Energy Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2021. This bipartisan legislation will amend the 1990 Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide federal financial assistance to states to improve their emergency planning functions. This includes funding to implement, review, and revise state energy security plans. Elevating energy security planning and emergency preparedness is important and urgent – whether a storm knocks out power to millions of homes or our energy grid is hacked – we must be prepared. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 398-21.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 983, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2021. This bill protects our veterans from targeted scams and financial predators. H.R. 983 establishes a new criminal offense for knowingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud an individual of veterans' benefits, or in connection with obtaining veteran's benefits for an individual. The bill also imposes a fine or imprisonment of up to five years for defrauding veterans. America’s veterans have put so much on the line to defend our great Nation and safeguard our freedoms. That’s why one of my top priorities in Congress is to ensure every American servicemember and veteran is well-equipped and properly supported, whether they are serving actively or have returned to civilian life. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 416-5.<br /><br /><strong>June 17, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 256, to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. This bill repeals current counterterrorism authorities without standing up a replacement that is scoped to current national security threats. H.R. 256 would only repeal the 2002 AUMF, which provides continuing legal authority for military operations against terrorist threats in Iraq, including Iran-backed militias. Repeal without a replacement sends the wrong message, and will only embolden our terrorist adversaries, including Iran and ISIS. It is critical that we undertake real war powers reform with an updated AUMF to address current threats, rather than play politics with national security. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 268-161. <br /><br /><strong>June 16, 2021 </strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act. This legislation would politicize the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by implementing a one-size-fits-all disclosure regime for publicly traded companies that will increase costs, discourage investment, and deter private companies from going public. H.R. 1187 would impose enormous compliance costs on public companies by vastly expanding required disclosures on environmental, social, and governance issues, including climate change and pay practices, with little to no congressional oversight. Public company reporting requirements are already extensive and protect investors by requiring companies to share information relevant to any investment risks. This bill does not increase transparency, instead it misuses the Securities and Exchange Commission to advance a progressive agenda that will end up hurting our economy. It will also harm American families that actively invest in the market or have retirement plans that do. Although this bill faced bipartisan opposition, it passed the House by a slim margin of 215-214.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.475, the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act. This bill establishes June 19 as an annual federal holiday known as, “Juneteenth National Independence Day.” Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, the day when Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, freeing the last remaining enslaved African Americans and marking the end of slavery in the United States.  In 1980, Texas became the first state to designate Juneteenth as a state holiday.  Since then, forty-eight other states and the District of Columbia have commemorated or recognized this important day in our Nation’s history.  S.475 passed the Senate by unanimous consent yesterday and today passed the House by a vote of 415-14.<br /><br /><strong>June 15, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on a package of 10 bipartisan bills, which passed the House by a vote of 287-140. This package includes legislation that will protect consumers, veterans , and our environment. The package also included a bill I cosponsored to provide a congressional Gold Medal to the Harlem Hellfighters. The complete list of bills included in this package is below:<br /><br />
1. H.R. 293 - VA Hospitals Establishing Leadership Performance Act<br />
2. H.R. 587 - Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II<br />
3. H.R. 610 - San Francisco Bay Restoration Act<br />
4. H.R. 1144 - PUGET SOS Act<br />
5. H.R. 1703 - National Children’s Museum Act<br />
6. H.R. 1921 - To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program, and for other purposes<br />
7. H.R. 2008 - Local Water Protection Act<br />
8. H.R. 2332 - Debt Bondage Repair Act<br />
9. H.R. 3642 - Harlem Hellfighters Congressional Gold Medal Act<br />
10. H.R. 2545 - To amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the role of doctors of podiatric medicine in the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes<br /><br />
I voted "No" on H.R. 239, the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act.  This bill prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from requiring payment from a veteran for any contraceptive item that is required to be covered by health insurance plans without a cost-sharing requirement. The bill would require taxpayers to bear the full cost of contraception through the VA, which includes forms of birth control like Plan B and Ella, which are abortifacients. This legislation required two-thirds to pass the House and failed by a vote margin of 240-188.<br /><br />
I voted "Yes" on H.R. 3325, to award four congressional gold medals to the United States Capitol Police and those who protected the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.  I have consistently condemned the actions of January 6, and applaud the heroism of the United States Capitol Police officers who defended our Nation’s Capital.  The legislation passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 406-21.<br /><br />
I voted "No" on H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act. I strongly support the equal rights and protections of all people, no matter their race, gender, religion, or sexuality. I have concerns that this bill could lead to preferences in the financial sector based on certain classifications. It also arbitrarily excludes certain groups of small businesses that are recognized or protected elsewhere in federal law, such as veteran-owned, Native American, and rural small businesses. As a small business owner, I have concerns whenever the government begins to arbitrarily pick winners and losers. This legislation required two-thirds to pass the House and failed by a vote margin of 248-177.<br /><br /><strong>May 20, 2021</strong><br />
Today, I voted “No” on H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security Supplemental Bill to Respond to January 6th Appropriations Act.  This bill puts the cart before the horse by appropriating $1.9 billion in emergency funding for, among other things, security upgrades to the Capitol before committees and the Architect of the Capitol have even determined what upgrades need to be made. House Democrats ended good faith negotiations with Republicans on this funding bill to once again make political headlines rather than good policy. One of the most troubling parts about this partisan bill is that it creates a $250 million slush fund to cover future unknown costs, without any guidelines for how these funds will or should be spent. It also provides $200 million to establish a Quick Reaction Force within the Washington, D.C. National Guard, which has raised serious concerns from Democrats and Republicans alike about the militarization of the Capitol and oversight of critical security functions in Congress. A proposal like this should be subjected to further scrutiny and debate by Congress before being rushed through the House. This bill was passed by a vote of 213-212-3.<br /><br /><strong>May 19, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act. This bill would institute limitations on market exclusivity for drugs designated as “orphan drugs” under Section 526(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This bipartisan bill closes a loophole that could be used to block pharmaceutical competition and prevent innovative treatments for rare conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 people from coming to market. I support commonsense bills like this that eliminate barriers for innovative medical-assisted treatments, boost competition, and drive down the cost of new medicine. This legislation passed the House by a wide margin vote of 402-23. I previously supported this legislation when it was considered by the House earlier this month as well.<br /><br />
I voted “No” on H. Res. 275, Condemning the horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021.  I strongly oppose discrimination and hate in all forms and just yesterday voted for a bill to provide the Department of Justice more resources to investigate hate crimes. However, this resolution erodes the rule of law by assuming facts in a case that have yet to be proven in court. This establishes a dangerous precedent for the House of Representatives, which should respect the independence of the judiciary and the role of law enforcement in conducting fair, transparent, and impartial investigations without undue influence. The shootings in Atlanta were horrific and I condemn them in the strongest terms. Their motivation has yet to be determined and should be left for a jury to decide based on facts, not influenced by political decisions made in advance by Congress. This resolution passed the House by a vote of 244-180.<br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 3233, the National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act. I condemn the unlawful acts at the US Capitol on January 6. Those who threaten, destroy, and steal property betray our fundamental Constitutional rights of free speech and peaceful assembly. Congress has the authority and the obligation to investigate the events of January 6 and should take steps to prevent lawlessness from occurring again. Congress and its committees of jurisdiction are fully equipped to handle this inquiry. They have subpoena power and subject-matter expertise. Most importantly, members of Congress must be accountable to the people, unlike a commission staffed with unelected, partisan appointees.  I fear that this commission is little more than a fishing expedition at the taxpayer's expense and will cherry pick the evidence to conform to the Democrat's narrative. Targeting individual members based on political views is also a grave concern. The very last revelation an outcome based inquiry will produce is the truth.  This commission passed the House by a vote of 252-175. The bill now goes to the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass. <br /><br /><strong>May 18, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on S.937, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. This bipartisan bill will expedite the review of hate crimes, especially those that occurred during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the bill designates a point person within the Justice Department to oversee efforts to ensure COVID-19-related hate crimes are reviewed in a timely manner and to provide additional support to local law enforcement agencies responding to such incidents. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 364-62. It passed the Senate earlier this year by a vote of 94-1. It will now be delivered to President Biden for his signature.<br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on a package of 21 bipartisan bills, which passed the House by a vote of 350-75. This package includes legislation that will support our nation’s veterans, protect our environment, boost STEM research, ensure fair access to our financial system, and secure our country’s foreign and diplomatic interests. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am especially pleased that the bipartisan State Department Authorization Act was included in this package. This bill will ensure the Department of State and our nation’s diplomats have the resources to advance our interests abroad.<br /><br />
The list of bills included in this package is below:</p><p><strong>1. H.R. 2704</strong> - Improving VA Accountability to Prevent Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Act of 2021<br /><strong>2.

Today, I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2911, the VA Transparency and Trust Act. This bipartisan legislation would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide information to Congress on a regular basis regarding how the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is using the tens of billions of dollars in emergency relief funding it received during the pandemic. It would also require the VA Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office to audit and report publicly on the VA’s emergency relief spending. This good governance bill provides needed transparency to ensure that the VA is a responsible steward of taxpayer money and that our veterans are receiving the care, resources, and support they deserve and have earned. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 411-4.</p><p><strong>May 14, 2021</strong><br />
Today, I voted ‘Yes” on H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This bipartisan legislation would establish additional workplace protections for pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. This bill includes safeguards and exemptions for small businesses and other employers, who are not required to make accommodations if they impose an undue hardship on their businesses. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 315-101.<br /><br /><strong>May 13, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 2547, the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act. This legislation consisted of a package of several partisan bills that would fundamentally and negatively transform the consumer credit market by making it more expensive for borrowers to access credit, increase costs for small businesses, deny access to credit for the lowest income borrowers, and undo efforts to modernize payment collection. The bottom line is that H.R. 2547 makes extending credit more expensive across the board, and could even push lower income borrowers out of the system entirely. Unfortunately, this legislation passed the House by a vote of 215-207. <br /><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 2877, the Behavioral Intervention Guidelines Act of 2021. This bill enables the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in consultation with the U.S. Department of Education and a wide array of other stakeholders to develop best practices for the proper use and implementation of behavioral intervention programs to help communities identify the earliest signs of violence to self or others. It is imperative that school administrators, teachers, and students have the mental health resources they need. This critical legislation will provide schools and communities the tools to ensure the safety and health of every student. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 323-93-2.<br /><br /><strong>May 12, 2021</strong><br />
Today, I voted “Yes” on a package of 16 bipartisan bills, which passed the House by a vote of 349-74. The package included two bills I cosponsored, H.R. 1448, the PAWs Act and H.R. 433, the Family Support Services for Addiction Act. The PAWs Act would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a pilot program on dog training therapy and provide service dogs to veterans with mental illnesses. H.R. 433 provides support for individuals and families struggling with substance use disorder. The legislative package also included a range of other important bills, including several more that provide additional resources to Americans struggling with mental health illness and that enhance suicide prevention services and training. Other legislation included in the package addresses child abuse in tribal communities. Supporting mental health is critical to supporting our communities, especially as we recover from a pandemic. I was pleased to see these bills pass the House of Representatives.<br /><br />
The complete list of bills included in this package is below:</p><p> </p><p><strong>1. H.R. 433</strong> - Family Support Services for Addiction Act of 2021<br /><strong>2. H.R. 1475</strong> - Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act, as amended<br /><strong>3. H.R. 586</strong> - STANDUP Act of 2021<br /><strong>4. H.R. 721</strong> - Mental Health Services for Students Act of 2021, as amended<br /><strong>5. H.R. 1260</strong> - Bipartisan Solution to Cyclical Violence Act of 2021, as amended<br /><strong>6. H.R. 1205</strong> - Improving Mental Health Access from the Emergency Department Act of 2021<br /><strong>7. H.R. 1324</strong> - Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act of 2021<br /><strong>8. H.R. 1480</strong> - HERO Act, as amended<br /><strong>9. H.R. 2862 </strong>- Campaign to Prevent Suicide Act, as amended<br /><strong>10. H.R. 2981</strong> - Suicide Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act of 2021<br /><strong>11. H.R. 2955</strong> - Suicide Prevention Act<br /><strong>12. H.R. 768</strong> - Block, Report, And Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2021<br /><strong>13. H.R. 1448 - </strong>PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act, as amended<br /><strong>14. H.R. 297 -</strong> To require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study on the establishment of, and the potential land that could be included in, a unit of the National Forest System in the State of Hawaii, and for other purposes<br /><strong>15. H.R. 478 - </strong>Blackwater Trading Post Land Transfer Act<br /><strong>16. H.R. 810 - </strong>To amend the National Trails System Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the feasibility of designating the Chief Standing Bear National Historic Trail, and for other purposes<br /><br /><strong>May 11, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act. This bill would institute limitations on market exclusivity for drugs designated as “orphan drugs” under Section 526(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This bipartisan bill closes a loophole that could be used to block pharmaceutical competition and prevent innovative treatments for rare conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 people from coming to market. I support commonsense bills like this that eliminate barriers for innovative medical-assisted treatments, boost competition, and drive down the cost of new medicine. This legislation required two-thirds to pass the House and failed by a vote margin of 250-168.<br /><br /><strong>April 22, 2021</strong><br />
I voted "No" on H.R. 51, regarding District of Columbia Statehood. This partisan legislation would unconstitutionally create a fifty-first state from land that was intentionally set aside to constitute the federal district for the nation’s Capital. This should not be a partisan issue. In fact, the Justice Department under both Democratic and Republican presidents has consistently agreed over the last 60 years that statehood can only be achieved through a constitutional amendment – it cannot simply be done by one majority vote in Congress, which is what House Democrats are proposing today. As legislators who take an oath to the Constitution, we must actually follow it. Sadly, today’s vote doesn’t align with the Constitution or the facts. But this push to make Washington, D.C. a state isn’t about the facts or fairness, it’s about politics. House Democrats have made no secret about wanting to add two seats to the Senate so they can more easily push through progressive agenda items like the Green New Deal, eliminating the filibuster, packing the Supreme Court, and defunding the police. While this may be their objective, they cannot go around the Constitution to do it, which is why I opposed this bill. H.R. 51 was adopted by a vote of 216-208.<br /><br /><strong>April 21, 2021</strong><br />
I voted “Yes” on H.R. 1392, the Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021. This bill makes certain that Saudi dissidents in the United States are protected from political and financial retribution from the Government of Saudi Arabia. At the core our great republic stands a belief that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly must be always be preserved and defended. I voted "Yes" on this bipartisan bill because Saudi Arabia must be held accountable for harming the individual rights and freedoms of dissenters, both inside Saudi Arabia and outside the country. This bill will not impact our ability to protect Saudi Arabia from outside threats, including threats posed by the Iranian regime. Iran has previously attacked Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure and the United States must continue to support our partners in the region against Iran’s malign activity. The bill provides a clear exception for arms sales for the defense of Saudi territory from external threats and for the protection of U.S. government personnel and facilities, which I strongly support. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 350-71.<br /><br />
I voted “No” on H.R. 1333, the No Ban Act. This bill restricts the President’s authority to suspend or restrict entry of certain aliens on the basis that their entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States due to a variety of threats, including to U.S. national security, financial markets, and public health. This bill creates dangerous limitations on all future presidents, Republican and Democrat alike. It limits their ability to keep the United States safe by placing onerous restrictions on their use of the 212(f) authority under current law, instead transferring greater power to unelected federal bureaucrats who are unaccountable to the American people. I voted against this legislation because it weakens our national security and invites litigation against the U.S. government for making decisions that are in the interest of our country. Most importantly, it does absolutely nothing to address the surging border crisis. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 218-208.<br /><br />
I also voted “No” on H.R. 1573, the Access to Counsel Act of 2021. This bill provides the right to consult with counsel for persons referred to secondary inspection at a U.S. port of entry. Requiring access to counsel during secondary inspections would severely affect the ability of Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents to quickly and safely screen millions of people and goods brought into the United States. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates this bill would cost American taxpayers $825 million over the next 5 years. I voted “No” on H.R. 1573 because we are in the middle of an unprecedented border crisis and this bill would negatively impact CBP’s ability to facilitate lawful trade and travel at a time when they are already stretched thin and under resourced. More unaccompanied children crossed illegally into the United States last month than ever before, and the problem is continuing to worsen as a result of the Biden Administration’s policies.  Our law enforcement agencies are so burdened that they are having difficulty complying with existing laws and regulations. It is irresponsible and out of touch for Congress to think that now is the time to place even more restrictions and mandates on CBP. Their focus must be on responding to the border crisis, and Congress should be coming together to make sure law enforcement has the tools, resources, and funding to do it effectively. The House adopted this legislation by a vote of 217-207.<br /><br /><strong>April 20, 2021</strong><br />
Today, I voted “Yes” on a package of 16 bipartisan bills, which passed the House by a vote of 355-69. This legislative package included a range of important bills and legislative fixes, including ones to foster greater growth, increase strategic planning at the Department of Homeland Security, and address errors in the Trusted Traveler Program. Other bills included in this package will strengthen global cybersecurity programs, protect seniors from financial scams, advance initiatives for young leaders and entrepreneurs in Africa, and reiterate our Nation’s strong support for the people of Belarus and their democratic aspirations as they strive for greater freedom.<br /><br />
The complete list of bills included in this package is below:</p><p>1. H.R. 2523 - Training in High-demand Roles to Improve Veteran Employment Act<br />
2. H.R. 490 - DHS MORALE Act<br />
3. H.R. 370 - Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2021<br />
4. H.R. 367 - Homeland Security Acquisition Professional Career Program Act<br />
5. H.R. 408 - Department of Homeland Security Mentor-Protégé Program Act of 2021<br />
6. H.R. 397 - CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2021<br />
7. H.R. 396 - Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act<br />
8. H.R. 1532 - Improving FHA Support for Small Dollar Mortgages Act of 2021<br />
9. H.R. 1491 - Fair Debt Collection for Servicemembers Act<br />
10. H.R. 1395 - Housing Financial Literacy Act of 2021<br />
11. H.R. 1565 - Senior Security Act<br />
12. H.R. 1528 - Promoting Transparent Standards for Corporate Insiders Act<br />
13. H.R. 1602 - Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021<br />
14. H.R. 1251 - Cyber Diplomacy Act of 2021<br />
15. H.Res. 124 - Supporting the people of Belarus and their democratic aspirations and condemning the election rigging and subsequent violent crackdowns on peaceful protesters by the illegitimate Lukashenka regime<br />
16. H.R. 965 - YALI Act of 2021<br /><br /><strong>April 19, 2021</strong><br />
H.R. 1996, the SAFE Banking Act of 2021 prohibits the federal government from penalizing a depository institution for providing banking services to a cannabis-related business operating legally in a state. I voted “Yes” on this bipartisan bill. While I have serious concerns with state-passed legislation legalizing marijuana, our small businesses and banking institutions shouldn’t pay the price. Current discrepancies between state and federal laws regarding marijuana create real uncertainty for small lenders and financial institutions. This bill ensures they will not be negatively impacted for complying with state law. This legislation was passed by the House by a vote of 321-101.<br /><br />
H.Res. 130 rightly condemns the People's Republic of China and the Government of Hong Kong for violating the human rights and individual freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. It also reaffirms American support for democratic protestors in Hong Kong and encourages the President to aid Hong Kong residents. I voted "Yes" on H.Res. 130. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, holding China accountable is one of my top priorities. We must continue to call out China for its ongoing efforts to extinguish democracy and freedom in Hong Kong, and elsewhere around the world. This legislation was passed by the House by a vote of 418-1.</p></div></div></article></div></div><aside class="col-sm-3 pull-right evo-right-sidebar"><div class="page__right__sidebar"><div class="block block--drupaltheme61-tenney-second-level-menu"><h2><a href="/about" data-drupal-link-system-path="node/15">About</a></h2><ul block="drupaltheme61_tenney_second_level_menu" class="nav flex-column"><li class="nav-item"><a href="/about" class="nav-link" data-drupal-link-system-path="node/15">About Claudia</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/about/committees-and-caucuses" class="nav-link" data-drupal-link-system-path="node/16">Committees and Caucuses</a></li><li class="nav-item active"><a href="/about/my-votes-explained" class="nav-link is-active" data-drupal-link-system-path="node/165">My Votes Explained</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/about/our-district" class="nav-link" data-drupal-link-system-path="node/17">Our District</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/about/votes-and-legislation" class="nav-link" data-drupal-link-system-path="node/18">Votes and Legislation</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div></div></div><!-- CONTENT END --><!-- POSTSCRIPT --><!-- POSTSCRIPT END --></main><!-- FOOTER --><footer class="page__footer evo-footer"><div class="container-fluid"><div class="d-flex"><div class="flex-fill evo-footer-right"><div class="views-element-container block block--drupaltheme61-tenney-evo-office-locations-block-list"><h2>Contact Us</h2><div block="drupaltheme61_tenney_evo_office_locations_block_list"><div class="office-locations js-view-dom-id-85295fb24c5889866bf5c39654be6b74856a374637158fc1cd300c8562731ba8"><div class="evo-view-evo-office-locations evo-view-wrapper"><div class="evo-views-row-container"><div class="views-row evo-views-row views-row-0 views-row-first"><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/contact/offices/washington-dc-office" hreflang="en">Washington DC Office</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-evo-address-address-line1"><span class="field-content">2349 Rayburn House Office Building</span></div><span><span>Washington, </span></span><span>DC&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="views-field views-field-field-evo-address-postal-code"><span class="field-content">20515</span></span><div class="views-field views-field-field-evo-phone"><span class="views-label views-label-field-evo-phone">Phone: </span><span class="field-content">(202) 225-3665</span></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-evo-office-hours"><h6 class="field-content"><span><p>Open Now: Monday through Friday, 9:00AM to 5:00PM</p></span></h6></div></div><div class="views-row evo-views-row views-row-1"><div class="views-field views-field-title"><span class="field-content"><a href="/contact/offices/watertown-satellite-office" hreflang="en">Watertown Satellite Office</a></span></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-evo-address-address-line1"><span class="field-content">317 Washington Street</span></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-evo-address-address-line2"><span class="field-content">Suite 418</span></div><span><span>Watertown, </span></span><span>NY&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="views-field views-field-field-evo-address-postal-code"><span class="field-content">13601</span></span><div class="views-field views-field-field-evo-office-hours"><h6 class="field-content"><span><p>Tuesday from 9:00 AM to 1:00PM<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
